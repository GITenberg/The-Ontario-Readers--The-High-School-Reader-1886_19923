<h1><br /><br /><br />PREFACE.</h1>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> selections in the <span class="smcap">High School Reader</span> have been chosen with the belief
that to pupils of such advancement as is required for entrance into High
Schools and Collegiate Institutes, oral reading should be taught from the best
literature, inasmuch as it not only affords a wide range of thought and sentiment,
but it also demands for its appropriate vocal interpretation such powers
of sympathy and appreciation as are developed only by culture; and it is to impart
culture that these institutions of higher learning have been established.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that it is from their ordinary reading books that pupils
obtain their chief practical acquaintance with literature, and the selections here
presented have been made with this in remembrance. They have been taken
from the writings of authors of acknowledged representative character; and they
have been arranged for the most part chronologically, so that pupils may unconsciously
obtain some little insight into the history of the development of the
literary art. They have also been so chosen as to convey a somewhat fair idea
of the relative value and productivity of authorship in the three great English-speaking
communities of the world<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the mother countries, our neighbours'
country, and our own.</p>

<p>While a limited space, if nothing else, prevents the collection here made from
being a complete anthology, yet it does pretend to represent the authors selected
in characteristic moods, and (in so far as is possible in a school book, and a
reading text-book) to present a somewhat fair perspective of the world of authorship.
It may be said that, if this be so, some names are conspicuously absent:
McGee, Canada's poet-orator; Parkman, who has given to our country a place
in the portraiture of nations; William Morris, the chief of the modern school of
romanticism; Tyndall, who of the literature of science has made an art; Lamb,
daintiest of humorists; Collins, "whose range of flight," as Swinburne says,
"was the highest of his generation." Either from lack of space, or from some
inherent unsuitableness in such selections as might otherwise have been made,
it was found impossible to represent these names worthily; but as they are all
more or less adequately represented in the <i>Fourth Reader</i>, the teacher who may
wish to correct the perspective here presented may refer his pupils to the pieces
from these authors there given. It may be added, too, that the body of recent
literature is so enormous, that no adequate representation of it (at any rate as
regards quantity) is possible within the limits of one book.</p>

<p>The selections in poetry, with but three necessary exceptions, are complete
wholes, and represent, as fairly as single pieces can, the respective merits and
styles of their authors. The selections in prose cannot, of course, lay claim to
this excellence; but they are all complete in themselves, or have been made so
by short introductions; and it is hoped that they too are not unfairly representative
of their authors. In many cases they are of somewhat unusual length;
by this, however, they gain in interest and in representative character.</p>

<p>In some of the prose selections, passages have occasionally been omitted, either
because they interfered with the main narrative, or because, as they added nothing
to it, to omit them would be a gain of space. In most cases these omissions
are indicated by small asterisks.</p>

<p>All the selections, both in prose and in verse, have been made with constant
reference to their suitableness for the teaching of reading. They are fitted to
exemplify every mode of expression, except, perhaps, that appropriate to a few
of the stronger passions. It is not pretended that they are all simple and easy.
Many of them will require much study and preparation before they can be read
with that precision of expression which is necessary to perfect intelligibility. The
chronological arrangement precludes grading; the teacher will decide in what
order the selections are to be read.</p>

<p>The introductory chapter is mainly intended to assist the teacher in imparting
to his pupils a somewhat scientific knowledge of the art of reading. Of course
the teacher will choose for himself his mode of dealing with the chapter, but it
has been written with the thought that he should use it as a convenient series of
texts, which he might expand and illustrate in accordance with his opportunities
and judgment. Examples for illustration are indispensable to the successful
study of the principles described, and they should be sought for and obtained by
the teacher and pupils together (whenever possible they should be taken from
the <span class="smcap">Reader</span>), and should be kept labeled for reference and practice. If the application
of these principles be thus practically made by the pupils themselves,
they will receive a much more lasting impression of their meaning and value than
if the examples were given to them at no cost of thought or search on their part.</p>

<p>To the teacher it is recommended that he should not be contented with the
short and necessarily imperfect exposition of the art of reading therein given.
The more familiar he is with the scientific principles the more successfully will he
be able to direct the studies and practices of his pupils. Works on elocution are
numerous and accessible. Dr. Rush's <i>Philosophy of the Voice</i> is perhaps the
foundation of all subsequent good work in the exposition of voice culture. Professor
Murdoch's <i>Analytic Elocution</i> is an exhaustive and scholarly treatise
based upon it, and to the plan of treatment therein fully developed the practical
part of the introductory chapter has largely conformed.</p>

<p>The pleasing task remains of thanking those authors who have so kindly responded
to requests for permission to use selections from their works: to President
Wilson, for a sonnet from <i>Spring Wild Roses</i>, and for <i>Our Ideal</i>; to Mr.
Charles Sangster, for two sonnets from <i>Hesperus</i>; to Mr. John Reade, for two
poems from <i>The Prophecy of Merlin</i>; to Mr. Charles Mair, for the scenes from
<i>Tecumseh</i>; and to Professor C. G. D. Roberts, for <i>To Winter</i>.</p>

<p>To Miss A. T. Jones, thanks are due for permission to use <i>Abigail Becker</i>,
recently published in the <i>Century Magazine</i>. The heroic acts described in this
poem seem so wonderful, so greatly superior to woman's strength, even to human
strength and endurance, to accomplish, that were it possible to doubt its
truthfulness, doubt one certainly would. Nevertheless the poem is not only
strictly in accordance with the facts, it is even within and below them.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ability to read well cannot be attained without much pains and study.
For even a moderate proficiency in the art of reading two requirements are
essential: (1) A cultivated mind quick to perceive the sequence of thoughts
which the words to be read logically express, and equally quick in its power
sympathetically to appreciate the sentiment with which the words are informed<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the
feeling, emotion, passion, which pervades them<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but which they suggest
rather than actually portray; and (2) a voice so perfected that its utterances fall
upon the ear of the listener with pleasing effect, and so flexible that it can be
managed skilfully to convey to him the full meaning and force of all the ideas
and sentiments formally expressed by the words or latent in them. Of these
two requirements the first is undeniably the more important; and that training
in the art of reading in which the close, persistent, and liberal study of literature
for its own sake has not proceeded <i>pari passu</i> with the requisite exercises for
the development of the powers of the voice and with the study of the principles
of vocal interpretation, has resulted in a meretricious accomplishment of very
illusive value.</p>

<p>Nor will the special study and accurate mastery of a number of individual
selections give that readiness of mental apprehension which is indispensable to a
good reader. The ability quickly to recognize word-forms and to utter them
with ease, to catch the drift of ideas, and to feel ready sympathy with change and
flow in sentiment, is not to be had without a long course of wide and varied
reading. No one can become a good reader by passing through, no matter
how carefully, a set of reading text-books merely. Pupils should be encouraged
to read for themselves. They should, of course, be guided in their selection of
reading matter, and they should be helped to acquire a taste for that which is
purest and most helpful in literature; but unless they form a <i>habit</i> of reading,
and of reading thoughtfully and with precision, they can never become good
readers.</p>

<p>In oral reading, readiness and accuracy depend largely upon the alertness and
flexibility of the vocal organs, and to secure ease and excellence in the working
of their delicate mechanism much practice is necessary. The pupil should persistently
read aloud. A practice of this sort, watchfully pursued, with a reasonable
degree of self-discipline in the correction or avoidance of errors, is helpful
not alone in obtaining a mastery of the reading art, and in mental culture,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it
is equally beneficial as a physical exercise. It will, however, be much more
efficacious of good, both of mind and of body, if pursued in accordance with
those principles of voice culture and of vocal interpretation, which experience
and special study have established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>But only a small proportion of all the reading that is done, is oral reading.
It is <i>silent</i> reading that is universally employed as an instrument of study, of
business, of amusement. As a rule, however, very little provision is made for
the acquirement of a facility in silent reading; this, it is thought, will result as
a by-product of the regular training in oral reading. Almost the reverse of this
is true. Ease and flexibility of articulation, quickness in catching the drift of
ideas, and readiness in varying the tones of the voice in the utterance of words
so as impressively to portray their latent sentiment,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>all this is possible with
those alone to whom difficult word-forms, complex sentence-structures, and the
infinite variety and play of thought and emotion, are more or less familiar
through such a wide range of reading as only the silent prosecution of it makes
possible.</p>

<p>The art of oral reading, however, though not so generally needful as silent
reading, is still of great importance to everyone in respect of its practical utility
simply,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>though few of those whose duty it is to read aloud in public, do so
either with accuracy or grace; as an accomplishment which may be used to
give pleasure to others, it is, when perfectly possessed, not excelled by any
other; so that as an acquisition which puts one in a position of vantage either
for benefitting one's self or for bestowing delight or benefit upon others, it is
worth every necessary struggle for its attainment.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable results of oral reading when systematically pursued
as a school study, is the effect which it has in improving the tones of the voice
for ordinary conversation and discourse, and in securing some measure of
orthoepy as a fixed habit of utterance. Conversational speech is notoriously
slovenly. The sonority of our vowels is lost, and their distinguishing qualities are
obscured; and with unnoticed frequency our consonants are either dropped or
amalgamated with one another. Yet, while amendment in these matters is to
be striven for, there is nothing that the teacher who wishes to establish habits of
orthoepy has to be more watchful in guarding against, than bestowing upon
his pupils an affected or mincing utterance, all the more ludicrous and objectionable,
it may be, in that a certain set of words are pronounced with over-nicety,
while almost all others are left in a state of neglected vulgarity.</p>

<p>Too frequently the study of oral reading is pursued with reference solely to
the prospective public use of the art in the declamation of prepared passages;
and the elocution-master's science has been brought into some discredit by wide
discrepancies between the performances of his pupils in their well-drilled and
often hackneyed selections and their ability to read unfamiliar pieces at sight.
It is quite true that voice culture is greatly aided by the close study and frequent
rendering of selections suitably chosen for the elocutionary difficulties which
they present; but it should never be forgotten that good reading, the sort of
reading which the schoolmaster should above all else endeavor to make his
pupils proficient in, implies the ability so to read a plain account, a story, an
oration, a play, or what not, <i>at sight</i>, with absolute correctness as to pronunciation,
with such clearness of articulation and appropriateness of sentence utterance as
will make it perfectly audible and intelligible to one's auditors, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
such suitable and impressive intonations as will put them in full possession of
those emotions which may be said to be the essence or spirit of the piece;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and,
moreover, to do all this with pleasure to one's hearers and with ease to one's
self. Now as comparatively few readers are ever required to read in public,
and as in the home-circle everyone ought to read, it is plain that the first duty
of the teacher of elocution is to develop in his pupils a mastery of such a style
of reading as is appropriate to small audiences; and, <i>then</i>, if he have time and
opportunity, to extend and amplify the practice of his art so as to fit such as are
capable of fuller mastery of it to appear before greater audiences. For though
all voices are capable of being much improved through cultivation, few only can
be adapted to the requirements of a large auditorium; and the care and attention
which should be devoted to the benefit of all should not be spent for the
advantage merely of the few.</p>

<p>And moreover, those practices and studies which voice culture and the attainment
of a knowledge of the principles of vocal interpretation demand, may be
pursued by all in common. That alone which is necessary for the public reader
or orator, is a more extended, and, perhaps, a more earnest and thoughtful
practice.</p>

<p>Although practices for the improvement of the voice cannot proceed far without
attention to the principles of vocal interpretation, and though the study of
the latter necessarily includes the former, yet for the sake of clearness the elementary
principles of voice culture may be discussed separately from their application
in the interpretation of thought and sentiment.</p>

<p>With respect both to articulation and expression <i>the generic properties of the
voice are five</i>, namely: <i>Quality</i>, <i>Pitch</i>, <i>Force</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Abruptness</i>. Of these
properties there are, of course, many modes or degrees, but the voice must, in
every tone that it utters, manifest itself in some mode or other of each; and it is
the possibility of infinite choice in the ways of combining the modes that gives to
vocal expression its infinite possibility of variety. The principles of voice culture
will be best understood, however, if these properties be considered separately.</p>

<p><b>Quality</b> has reference to the <i>kind</i> of the voice in respect of its smoothness or
roughness, sonority or thinness, musicalness or harshness; also in respect of the
completeness of its vocality.</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b> has reference to the degree of elevation or depression in what is called
in music the <i>scale</i>. It may be used specifically, in reference to single tones or
syllables (either as to their opening, or as to their whole utterance), or generally,
as descriptive of the prevailing tone or note which the voice assumes in reading
a sentence or passage.</p>

<p><b>Force</b> has reference to the power or intensity with which the sounds of the
voice are uttered. When force is used in the utterance of single syllables, in
whole or in part, it is spoken of as <b>Stress</b>.</p>

<p><b>Time</b> is rate of utterance. It is used with reference both to single syllables,
and to phrases, sentences, and passages. In regard to single syllables it is
sometimes called <b>Quantity</b>. In the consideration of time may be included that
of <i>pauses</i> and <i>rhythms</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span><b>Abruptness</b> has reference to the relative suddenness with which syllables may
be uttered. It may vary from the most delicate opening to a forcible explosion.</p>

<p>Vocality depends upon respiration. All exercises, therefore, which are effective
in increasing the vigor, freedom, and elasticity of the breathing apparatus,
may be taken as initiatory steps in voice culture; and, in moderation, they
should be practised continually. Full, slow inspirations followed by slow, and,
as far as possible, complete expirations; full, quick inspirations similarly followed;
full inspirations followed by sudden and forcible expirations; full, deep
inspirations, followed by slow, slightly but distinctly audible expirations, as in
deep sighing; these and similar practices may be pursued. What is to be
aimed at is to secure complete control of the breath, especially to the degree
that, with perfect deliberateness, it can be equably and smoothly effused.</p>

<p>In all exercises where vocality is required it is best <i>first</i> to use the sound of <ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins>,
as in <i>far</i>, for in this sound the quality of the human voice is heard in most perfection,
and in uttering it the vocal organs are most flexible and most easily
adapt themselves to change. It may be preceded by the aspirate <i>h</i>, or by some
consonant, as may be thought necessary.</p>

<p>In effective speaking or reading, <i>with respect to the abruptness and rapidity
of expiration there are three modes of utterance</i>: the <b>effusive</b>, by which the
voice is poured forth smoothly and equably, the <b>expulsive</b> and the <b>explosive</b>.
Of these three modes the effusive is by far the most important, but the others,
and especially the expulsive, have their uses also. These modes will be illustrated
in the following exercise:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise.</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the expiration of the
element <i>h</i> be gently effected, until the lungs are exhausted<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the aspiration
coming from the very depths of the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable
<i>h</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins><i>h</i>, audibly whispered. This is <i>effusive</i> utterance.</p>

<p>2. After a full and deliberate inspiration let the expiration of the element <i>h</i>
be suddenly effected, the expiration being continued until the whispering sound
vanishes in the bottom of the throat. Let this be repeated with the syllable <i>h</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins><i>h</i>,
audibly whispered. This is <i>expulsive</i> utterance.</p>

<p>3. Let the exercise be the same as in (2) except that the expiration is to be
much more forcibly effected, and completed almost instantaneously. This is
<i>explosive</i> utterance.</p></div>

<p>In the cultivation of the voice either one of two ends is generally kept in
view<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>its improvement for speaking or its improvement for singing; but progress
may be made towards both ends by the same study, and those exercises
which benefit the singing voice benefit the speaking voice, and <i>vice versa</i>. <i>The
distinction between speaking tones and singing tones should be clearly understood.</i>
Musical tones are produced by isochronous (equal-timed) vibrations of
the vocal organs continued for some length of time. Hence, a musical tone is a
<i>note</i>, which may be prolonged at will without varying in pitch, either up or
down. A speaking tone, on the contrary, is produced by vibrations which are
not isochronous; it is not a <i>note</i>, properly so called, and can not be prolonged,
without varying in pitch. Musical tones are <i>discrete</i>,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the voice passes from
pitch to pitch through the intervals silently. In speaking, <i>every</i> tone, however
short the time taken in uttering it, passes from one pitch to some other through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
an interval <i>concretely</i>, that is, with continuous vocality; though, with respect to
one another, speech syllables, like notes in music, are discrete. This may be exemplified
by uttering the words, "<i>Where are you going?</i>" In singing these words,
they may be uttered on the same note, or on different notes, or, indeed, with different
notes for the same word; but the voice <i>skips</i> from note to note through the
intervals. In speaking the words, each is uttered with an inflection or intonation
in which the voice varies in pitch, but passes through the interval concretely;
the separate words, however, and the separate syllables (if there were
any) being uttered discretely. Musical utterance might be graphically illustrated
by a series of horizontal lines of less or greater length succeeding one another
at different distances above or below a fixed horizontal line. In a similar notation
for speech utterance the lines would all be curved, to represent the concrete
passage through the various intervals. <i>It is the concrete intonation of every
syllable and monosyllabic word which gives to speech its distinctive character
from music.</i> Each syllable and monosyllabic word is called a <b>concrete</b>, and
<i>it is with the concrete in all its various possibilities of utterance that voice culture
has mainly to do</i>.</p>

<p>The intervals traversed by the voice in uttering the concrete are very variable.
Using the musical scale for reference it may be said that in ordinary speech they
are generally of but one, or, at most, two notes. In animated discourse or passionate
utterance the intervals may be greater. For illustration, let the pronoun
"<i>I</i>" be uttered in a tone of interrogative surprise; a concrete with a rising
interval will be the result. The more the surprise is emphasized, especially if
indignation be conjoined with it, the greater will be the interval that the voice
passes through in uttering the concrete. If the word "<i>lie</i>" be given immediately
after the pronoun with the same intensity of feeling, the voice discretely
descends from the high pitch heard at the end of the utterance of the pronoun,
and in uttering the next concrete, again ascends through an interval, of less or
more extent according to the emphasis which is imparted to it.</p>

<p>Again, in speech of sorrow, murmuring, piteous complaint, and the like, concrete
intervals of less extent than those used in ordinary discourse are often
heard. Thus, if the sentence "<i>Pity me, kind lady, I have no mother</i>," be uttered
with a plaintive expression, concretes with small intervals will be distinctly
noticeable; but it will be also noticed that with respect to one another the syllables
are discretely uttered, just as in the sentence where the concrete intervals
were much greater.</p>

<p>Without intending a scientifically accurate and rigid statement, it may be said
(again borrowing the terminology of music) that in ordinary speech the concretes
are uttered with intervals of a <i>second</i>, or at most a <i>third</i>; that in very
expressive or impassioned utterance intervals of a <i>fifth</i> or an <i>octave</i> are frequently
used; and that the mode of progression from syllable to syllable is
<i>diatonic</i>, that is, not concretely, but discretely from tone to tone; and further,
that in plaintive language, the syllables are uttered concretely with intervals of a
<i>semitone</i> only, but that the mode of progression from syllable to syllable is still
discrete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>Sometimes, but rarely, syllables are uttered <i>tremulously</i>, or with a <i>tremor</i>;
that is, with constituent intervals of less than a semitone, uttered discretely in
rapid succession, and passing, in the aggregate, through an interval of more or
less width. An exaggerated form of this utterance may be heard in the neighing
of a horse.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1. Utter the syllable <i>p</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins> as a concrete, with rising and falling
intervals, severally, of a <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>, <i>fifth</i>, and an <i>octave</i>; also with intervals
of a <i>semitone</i>; also with a <i>tremor</i>. Let the exercise be varied so as to include
many degrees of initial pitch. Use a diagram of a musical staff for reference.</p>

<p>2. Read with exaggerated impressiveness, "<i>Am</i> <b>I</b> <i>to be your slave?</i> <b>No!</b>"</p></div>

<p>In the pronunciation of the letter <ins class="translit" title="a macron"><i>&#257;</i></ins>, as in <i>pate</i>, two sounds are heard: the
first is that of the name of the letter, which is uttered with some degree of fulness;
the second is that of <ins class="translit" title="e with macron"><i>&#275;</i></ins> in <i>mete</i>, but, as it were, tapering and vanishing;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in
the meantime the voice traverses a rising interval of one tone, that is, of a
second. The utterance of these two sounds, although the sounds themselves
are distinct, is completely continuous, from the full opening of the one to the
vanishing close of the other, and it is impossible to say where the first ends and
where the last begins. It is essential, however, to consider them separately.
The first is called the <b>radical movement</b>, and the second the <b>vanishing
movement</b>; and these together constitute the entire concrete.</p>

<p>All the vowels do not equally well exemplify in their utterance a <i>distinction
of sound</i> in their radical and vanishing movements, because some vowel sounds
are less diphthongal than others, and some, again, are pure monophthongs;
but <i>these two movements and the concrete variation of pitch, the result of one
impulse of the voice, are the essential structure of every syllable</i>, and are characteristic
of speech-notes as contradistinguished from those of song.</p>

<p>When the radical and vanishing movements are effected smoothly, distinctly,
and without intensity or emotion, commencing fully and with some abruptness,
and terminating gently and almost inaudibly, the result is the <b>equable concrete</b>.
This of course may be produced with intervals, either upward or downward,
of any degree<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>tone, semitone, third, fifth, or octave. It must be said, however,
that some syllables, and even some vowels, lend themselves more easily
than others to that prolonged utterance which is essential to the production
of wide intervals and the perfectness of the vanishing movement.</p>

<p>The equable concrete is the natural, simple mode of utterance; but under the
influence of interest, excitement, passion, and so on, the utterance of the concrete
may be greatly varied from this by means of <i>stress</i>, or force applied to
some part or to all of its extent. The different variations may be described as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) <b>Radical Stress</b>, where force is applied to the opening of the concrete. (It
should be said that a slight degree of radical stress is given even in the equable
concrete, producing its full, clear opening.)</p>

<p>(2) <b>Loud Concrete</b>, where force is applied throughout the whole concrete, the
proportion of the radical to the vanish remaining unaltered.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Median Stress</b>, where force is applied to the middle of the concrete, producing
a swell, or impressive fulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>(4) <b>Compound Stress</b>, where force is applied in an unusual degree to each
extremity of the concrete.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Final Stress</b>, where force is applied to the end of the concrete, the radical
stress being somewhat diminished in fulness.</p>

<p>(6) <b>Thorough Stress</b>, where force is so applied that the concrete has the
same fulness throughout.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>With the syllable <i>p</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins> exemplify the <i>equable concrete</i> and the several
varieties of <i>stress</i>, using different degrees of initial or radical pitch, and the
various intervals of the tone, semitone, third, fifth, and octave. The exercises
for the radical stress should be first aspirated, then repeated with full vocality.</p></div>

<p>Besides the forms of the simple rising and falling intervals in which the concrete
is generally uttered, there is another form, called the <b>wave</b>, effected by a
union of these modes. It is of two varieties: (1) where a rising movement is
continued into a falling movement, called the <b>direct wave</b>; (2) where a falling
movement is continued into a rising movement, called the <b>inverted wave</b>.
Waves may pass through all varieties of intervals, and may be either (1) <i>equal</i>,
where the voice in both members passes through the same interval; or (2)
<i>unequal</i>, where in one flexion the interval traversed by the voice is greater than
in the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>With the syllable <i>p</i><ins class="translit" title="a with macron"><i>&#257;</i></ins> exemplify the different kinds of <i>waves</i>, with the same variations of radical pitch, interval, and stress, as before.</p></div>

<p>The elementary sounds of speech are of three natural divisions; the <i>tonics</i>,
the <i>subtonics</i>, and the <i>atonics</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Tonics</b> are the simple vowels and diphthongs. They are of perfect
vocality; they admit the concrete rise and fall through all the intervals of pitch;
they may be uttered with more abruptness than the other elements; and being
capable of indefinite prolongation they can receive the most perfect exemplification
of the vanishing movement. They may be said to be: <ins class="translit" title="a with double dot below possibly a&#804;"><i>a&#804;</i></ins>, as in <i>all</i>; <ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins>, as in <i>arm</i>; <ins class="translit" title="a with dot above, possibly &#775;"><i>a&#775;</i></ins>, as in <i>ask</i>; <ins class="translit" title="a breve"><i>&#259;</i></ins>, as in <i>an</i>; <ins class="translit" title="a macron"><i>&#257;</i></ins>, as in <i>ate</i>; <ins class="translit" title="a circumflex"><i>&#226;</i></ins>, as in <i>air</i>; <ins class="translit" title="e macron"><i>&#275;</i></ins>, as in <i>eve</i>; <ins class="translit" title="e breve"><i>&#277;</i></ins>, as in <i>end</i>; <ins class="translit" title="e diaresis"><i>&#235;</i></ins>, as in <i>err</i>; <ins class="translit" title="i macron"><i>&#299;</i></ins>, as in <i>ice</i>; <ins class="translit" title="i breve"><i>&#301;</i></ins>, as in <i>inn</i>; <ins class="translit" title="o macron"><i>&#333;</i></ins>, as in <i>old</i>; <ins class="translit" title="o diaresis"><i>&#337;</i></ins>, as in <i>or</i>; <ins class="translit" title="o breve"><i>&#335;</i></ins>, as in <i>odd</i>; <ins class="translit" title="u macron"><i>&#363;</i></ins>, as in <i>use</i>; <ins class="translit" title="u breve"><i>&#365;</i></ins>, as in <i>up</i>; <ins class="translit" title="o macron o macron"><i>&#333;&#333;</i></ins>, as in <i>ooze</i>; <ins class="translit" title="o breve o breve"><i>&#335;&#335;</i></ins>, as in <i>book</i>; <i>oi</i>, as in <i>oil</i>;
<i>ou</i>, as in <i>out</i>. (There are various ways of arranging and classifying these.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Exemplify generally the equable concrete, loud concrete, radical
stress, and median stress, with upward and downward intervals, with clear,
sharp openings, and with gradually attenuated vanishes, upon each of the <i>tonic
elements</i>.</p></div>

<p>The <b>Subtonics</b> possess the properties of vocality and prolongation in some
degree, but much less perfectly than the tonics, and their vocality (known as
the <i>vocal murmur</i>) is the same for all. They are as follows:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>y</i>,
<i>w</i> (as in <i>woe</i>), <i>th</i> (as in <i>then</i>), <i>zh</i> (as <i>z</i> in <i>azure</i>), j (as in <i>judge</i>, by some considered
not elementary), <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>ng</i> (as in <i>sing</i>), <i>r</i> (as in <i>ran</i>), and <i>r</i> (as in <i>far</i>).
They can not, without great effort, be given an abrupt opening, and so are not
capable of much radical fulness, but from their property of vocality they can
receive, to a considerable degree, an exemplification of the vanishing movement.</p>

<p>Syllables vary greatly in their capacity for prolongation, and in this respect
are classified into <i>immutable</i>, <i>mutable</i>, and <i>indefinite</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span><b>Immutable Syllables</b> are almost incapable of prolongation; they are those
which end in one of the abrupt atonic elements, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>; as <i>tip</i>, <i>hit</i>, <i>kick</i>; or in
one of the abrupt subtonics, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>; as <i>tub</i>, <i>thud</i>, <i>pug</i>. Some syllables that so
end, by virtue of tonic or subtonic elements which they may contain, are capable
of <i>some</i> prolongation; for example, <i>warp</i>, <i>dart</i>, <i>block</i>, <i>grab</i>, <i>dread</i>, <i>grog</i>.
These are called <b>Mutable Syllables</b>.</p>

<p><b>Indefinite Syllables</b> are capable of almost indefinite prolongation; they are
those which terminate in a tonic, or any subtonic except one of the three abrupt
subtonics, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>; for example, <i>awe</i>, <i>fudge</i>, <i>hail</i>, <i>arm</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>It must be remembered that when for the sake of exercise or effect
syllables are extended in time, they must be so uttered that their identity is not
impaired,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is, their enunciation must be free from mouthing.</p>

<p>As has been remarked before our pronunciation of vowels is notoriously careless;
but by a little attention anyone can easily free himself from this reproach.
Frequent practice in the accurate enunciation of the tonic elements as given
above, and a habit of watchfulness established as to the orthoepy of those which
are most easily obscured, in all words in which they occur, will soon secure, if
not a resonant, sonorous utterance with respect to the tonic elements, at least a
correct pronunciation. But the correct and distinct pronunciation of the subtonic,
and especially of the atonic, elements, when they occur, as is so frequent
in English words, in combination, is not so easily accomplished; and orthoepy,
in this respect, as a <i>habit</i>, cannot be secured without great care and incessant
practice. For example, the word <i>months</i> is habitually pronounced by almost
everyone as if it were spelled <i>munce</i>. The following list for practice will afford
material to begin with; other lists should be prepared by the teacher.</p>

<p><i>Plinth, blithe, sphere, shriek, quote, whether, tipt, depth, robed, hoofed, calved,

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Utter the words in the above list in distinct articulate whispers;
then with vocality, softly and gently. Avoid hissing and mouthing.</p></div>

<p>While, in reading, distinct enunciation is an excellence to be aimed at, yet the
words of a sentence should not be uttered as if completely severed from one
another. Every sentence falls naturally into <i>groups</i>, the several groups being
composed of words related in sense; and for impressive reading the words of
each group should be <i>implicated</i>, or tied together. For example, in the line,
<i>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd, weak and weary</i>, there are
naturally three groups; in the line, <i>The quality of mercy is not strain'd</i>, there is
but one. In these groups the terminal sound of each word is implicated with
the initial sound of the succeeding word. If the terminal sound is a tonic, or a
flowing subtonic, the implication consists of a gentle murmuring prolongation
of the terminal element coalescing with the initial element of the next word; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
the terminal element is a flowing atonic the prolongation will not be accompanied
by a murmur; but in either case the vocal organs, while prolonging the
sound of one word, prepare, as it were, to begin the next. If the terminal element
be one of the abrupt subtonics the vocal murmur is difficult to produce,
and in this case, and also when the terminal element is an abrupt atonic, there
is a suspension of the voice for a time equal to that occupied by the murmuring
prolongation in the other cases; but the organs keep the position which they
have in finishing the one word until they relax to take position for the utterance,
with renewed exertion, of the opening sound of the next.</p>

<p>It must be added that this implication is not confined to the component words
of a group; for the sake of impressiveness the groups themselves are often
implicated,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but by suspension of the voice and a maintenance of the vocal
organs in their previous position, before they suddenly relax to form the opening
sound of the first word in their next group, rather than by the murmuring
prolongation above described.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Read with suitable implication: (1) <i>O Tiber! father Tiber! to
whom the Romans pray, a Roman's life, a Roman's arms, take thou in charge
this day!</i> (2) <i>But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard, in bright succession
raise, her ornament and guard.</i></p></div>

<p>The nicety with which implication should be effected depends, like exactness
of articulation, upon the gravity, complexity, fervor, grace, beauty, or other distinguishing
and elevated quality of the thoughts and sentiments contained in the
words to be read. Common-place ideas are couched, as a rule, in common-place
language, and require no nice discrimination of sounds, or other refinement
of utterance, for their full rendering; but in true poetry and impassioned
prose implication is no mean instrument of effectual interpretation.</p>

<p>The speaking voice, like the singing voice, is capable of utterance through a
considerable range of pitch<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in highly cultivated voices, of three octaves; in less
highly cultivated voices, of one octave; but for all voices, not perverted by bad
habit, there are three or four notes, of moderate height, upon which utterance is
most easy and natural, and most capable of great and sustained effort. These
notes should be selected as the <b>normal pitch</b> of discourse.</p>

<p>In speaking or reading, except in certain infrequent cases, the <i>whole</i> of the
breath expired from the lungs should be utilized in producing <b>pure vocality</b>.
Should any breath be spent in aspiration, or in hissing, or in guttural enunciation,
the vocality is said to be <b>impure</b>. Impure vocality, it is true, has its own appropriate
use, in the representation of certain emotional states of the mind. Pure
vocality is heard naturally in the tones of children at play; but in adults,
through carelessness or injudicious education, it is often wanting.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the voice is very complicated and not thoroughly understood.
It is a matter of common experience, however, that in the utterance of
tones of low pitch, whether speech tones or musical, the voice seems to come
from the chest rather than from the head; and, in the utterance of tones of
high pitch, on the other hand, it seems to come from the head rather than from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the chest; so that all tones are said to belong either to the <i>lower</i> or <i>chest register</i>,
or to the <i>higher</i> or <i>head register</i>. As both chest tones and head tones may
be obscured by impurities, and their resonance diminished or destroyed by
defective enunciation, the pure, clear, ringing utterance of tones of both registers
should be constantly striven for. The normal pitch of utterance, referred
to above, should always be such that the tones comprised in it can be produced
either from the head or from the chest, at will; but for sustained efforts, for the
best effects both of reading and of oratory, the chest tones are much to be preferred,
since, as compared with head tones, they are capable of being produced
with greater resonance and penetrating power, and, for any considerable length
of time, with greater ease to the speaker.</p>

<p>All tones of the human voice, whether speaking or musical, whether of the
head or of the chest, are spoken of as having <b>quality</b>, or <b>timbre</b>, and the term
is also used more generally in reference to the whole compass of utterance.
The quality of the voice is its most distinguishing characteristic, and it is upon
its cultivation and improvement that the greatest efforts of the student should
be spent. Pure voice is usually spoken of as being manifested in two qualities,
the <i>natural</i> and the <i>orotund</i>.</p>

<p><b>Natural Quality</b> may be described as a head tone to which some degree of
resonance is given by the chest; but the brilliancy of its resonance is produced
by its reverberation against the bony arch of the mouth. It may, of course, vary
in pitch, but tones of low pitch that are intended to be impressive are most
suitably rendered in orotund quality. In its perfect manifestations, the natural
quality should be clear, ringing, light, and sparkling,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if it be possible to
describe its characteristics by such metaphorical words.</p>

<p><b>Orotund Quality</b> is the result only of cultivation, but no speaker or reader
can produce those finer effects which are the appropriate symbols of strong and
deep emotion, whose voice cannot assume this mode at will. It differs from the
natural mode in obtaining from the chest a greater supply of air, and a deeper
and fuller resonance, and the reverberations seem to be against the walls of the
pharynx, or posterior regions of the mouth, rather than against the palate, or
upper part of the mouth. In fulness, strength, and ringing quality, it is superior
to the natural mode, but not distinct from it; in clearness and smoothness
it should be equal to it. As it befits a chest tone rather than a head tone, it is
natural to utterances in medium and low pitch; but it must not be confounded
with low pitch simply, nor must its characteristic fulness be taken for loudness
simply. With the orotund, as well as with the natural quality, all the voice
modes previously described may be conjoined.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1. With the syllable <i>h</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins><i>h</i>, make an expiration in the voice of
whisper, forcing slowly all air out from the chest. Then give to this expiration
vocality, producing the reverberation far back in the mouth: the resulting utterance
is a <i>hoarse exemplification of the orotund</i>. With the mouth in the position
of a yawn, making the cavity of reverberation as large as possible, repeat the
exercise until the utterance can be produced smoothly and without hoarseness.
2. Form similar syllables containing other tonic elements, and make similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
exercises, taking care to produce a smooth, effusive utterance. 3. Select a sentence
such as "<i>Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll</i>," abounding in long
open vowels and indefinite syllables, and using suitable intonations read it in
low pitch, with full, resonant chest tones. Then gradually raise the pitch, still
obtaining the tones from the chest and uttering them with full resonance. 4.
With such syllables as <i>h</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins><i>h</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>war</i>, <i>hail</i>, <i>fool</i>, practise in orotund
voice the various exercises for pitch, concrete intervals, waves, stress, etc., previously
suggested. 5. Read with feeling and appropriate intonations selected
sentences from compositions of elevated or impassioned diction, as "Solomons's
Prayer" <a href="#i">(p. 35)</a>, "The Hymn" <a href="#ix">(p. 68)</a>, "France" <a href="#xxxii">(p. 205)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the various qualities (as they are called) of impure voice, the <b>Aspirate</b>, the
<b>Sibilant</b>, and the <b>Guttural</b> are defined with sufficient clearness, by their names.
Though these modes can be appropriately used only occasionally, nevertheless
they are of great value to the reader, and the voice should be trained to assume
them whenever necessary. Great care must be exercised, however, that impurities
shall never be present as characteristics of <i>normal</i> utterance; this, whether
from the head or chest, should be distinct, sonorous, and smooth, and should
exhaust every particle of air expired.</p>

<p>Another impure quality is the <b>Pectoral</b>, which is an aspiration produced, as
it were, from the lowest cavities of the chest; and still another is the <b>Falsetto</b>,
an unnatural voice, that seems to be produced entirely in the upper cavities of
the head. The employment of the Falsetto at any time, either in speaking or
reading, is of doubtful taste.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Exercise</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1. With the syllable <i>h</i><ins class="translit" title="a diaresis"><i>&#228;</i></ins><i>h</i> exemplify severally the aspirate, guttural,

Exemplify the sibilant impurity with such syllables as <i>pish</i>, <i>false</i>, <i>traitress</i>, <i>miscreant</i>.
In those exercises employ intervals of varying lengths, different degrees
of initial pitch, and the several varieties of stress; and let the utterances be made
effusively, expulsively, and explosively. 2. Select appropriate passages in "The
Raven" <a href="#lii">(p. 258)</a> for exercise in natural, orotund, aspirate, guttural, and pectoral
qualities. Read the passages severally with appropriate intonations,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it
may be somewhat exaggeratingly. Then read the whole poem feelingly, with
appropriate, but not exaggerated intonations.</p></div>

<p>So far, what has been said has had reference mainly to the cultivation and
improvement of the voice, by the analogies and description of the various effective
modes in which it can be manifested, and by the suggestion of suitable
exercises for increasing its endurance, strength, flexibility, and resonance. It
remains now to discuss shortly some of the principles of <i>vocal interpretation</i>,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that
is, to discuss what modes of voice-action are appropriate to the representation
of the various emotions which the wide range of literature presents to the
reader.</p>

<p>It must be said in respect of principles that only broad and easily verifiable
ones are of use, and even these may be abused by a too rigorous adherence to
them. The best rule that can be given, as indeed it is founded on a principle
of widest application, is that laid down in the <i>Fourth Reader</i>:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>To give a faithful
sympathetic attention to the full meaning and sentiment of what is read, and
to manage the voice so as effectively to express this meaning and sentiment;</i> since
this will always ensure a certain measure of appropriateness, if not the full per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>fection
of it. And it cannot be too much emphasized that even the fullest knowledge
and most patient study can establish for the reading of any selection, or
passage, or sentence, <i>none but general directions</i>, since the same words may
very frequently be rendered in several ways, with differences of pitch, time,
stress, quality, implication, and so on, but with equal effectiveness and equal
appropriateness. And, on the other hand, any whole selection, even the simplest,
is far too complex in its thought and sentiment to be disposed of in one
general analysis, which shall predetermine the pitch, tone, and stress, and the
prevailing width of the intervals, and the direction of the inflections; all these
will vary from paragraph to paragraph, and from sentence to sentence, even
from word to word. To sum up, it may be said that good reading demands as
indispensable, quick-witted intelligence, ready sympathy, and a voice so trained
as to be flexible and resonant; if the reader have this much endowment his
reading will always be effective, and, moreover, appropriate and impressive.</p>

<p><i>All diction may be roughly described as exhibiting one of three states of feeling:</i>
(1) that in which feeling, as it is generally understood, is almost wanting; (2)
that in which it is present in some considerable degree; (3) that in which the
feeling is present in an extreme degree, dominating the ideas which the several
sentences logically express. To the first division, which may be called the
<b>diction of discourse</b>, belongs all language indicative of a quiet state of mind<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>formal
statement, narrative, description, simple argument or reasoning: it is
the language of all ordinary writing. To the second division, which may be
called the <b>diction of sentiment or feeling</b>, belongs all language which indicates
that the mind of the speaker, real or supposed, is in a state of moderate
excitement; that he is interested in the relation of himself to others, and, consequently,
in the effect of his utterances upon them; or that, subjectively, he
is interested in himself: it is the language of admiration, reverence, awe, sincerity,
dignity, of pathos, supplication, penitence. To the third division, which
may be called the <b>diction of passion</b>, belongs all language expressive of deeper
excitement and more vehement interest than that described as animating the
diction of feeling: it is the language of earnest or anxious interrogation, of
passionate ejaculation, of powerful appeal, strong accusation, and fierce denunciation;
also, of contempt, derision, scorn, loathing, anger, hate, and so on.</p>

<p>Voice, as we have seen, possesses five generic properties, pitch, force, quality,
time, and abruptness; and, in every spoken word, it must assume some mode
of <i>each</i> of these properties, manifesting them in co-existence. This conjoint
mode, or <i>vocal sign</i>, as it is called, should be the appropriate expression of the
thought and feeling of which the word, in its place in the sentence, is the
<i>graphical sign</i>. Hence, as each word in a sentence may be said to have its
appropriate vocal sign, so each variety of diction may be said to have its appropriate
vocal expression,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a latitude of choice in the constituent modes, and a
consequent indeterminateness in the resulting expression, being, of course, always
conceded.</p>

<p>The appropriate vocal expression for the diction of discourse may be said to
consist of the following modes:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>normal pitch, simple intonations, and waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
of a second, moderate force, the equable concrete varied by slight radical stress,
in quality the natural mode, in abruptness sufficient sharpness of opening to
effect clear articulation, and in time a moderate rate with effusive utterance.</p>

<p>As the diction rises above this plain unimpassioned character, and becomes
more and more informed with feeling and sentiment, the constituent vocal signs,
and hence the whole vocal expression, become more and more expressive. In
pitch there is frequent variation: in expressions of joy, astonishment, or for command,
the voice assumes naturally a somewhat higher elevation; and with equal
naturalness it descends below its normal level to utter the language of grave,
solemn, and reverential feeling. Again, inasmuch as the interval of the second
is the plainest and simplest within the command of the voice, in such diction as
we are now considering, intervals of a third, a fifth, or even an octave, may be
heard, both in simple intonations and in waves. Force, too, will not be unvaryingly
applied, but will be greater or less according as energy or passion may
demand. In stress the equable concrete will give place to the radical or to the
final, to express energetic resolve; or, in the language of pathos, exaltation,
reverence, supplication, and so on, to the median<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the most effective of all
modes for the expression of such deep feeling as is compatible with slow utterance.
In time the rate of utterance will vary with the syllabic quantities, these
being short and crisp in the language of vivacious conversation, but extended,
and with distinct, attenuated vanishes, in grave and important monologue. In
quality, whenever the diction, departing from its simple character, becomes pervaded
by some deep emotion, the natural mode will give place to the orotund.
And while effusive utterance is always the prevalent mode, it will give place to
the expulsive mode or to the explosive, when energy of thought or force of
passion requires it so.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>as the diction rises</i> from plain discourse to the language of feeling, <i>the
appropriate vocal expression gathers intensity and becomes more varied</i>, assumes,
as may be said, brighter colors and displays greater contrasts; and so, in the
third class of diction, the diction of passion, it displays its intensest and most
vivid modes<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>its brightest colors, its deepest contrasts.</p>

<p>As it is in a general sense only, that diction can be understood to be referrible
to three classes, so also, in a general sense only, can it be understood that any
particular sentence or passage has its appropriate vocal expression. All that is
intended is simply this: an analysis of the sentence, or passage, or selection, gives
to the careful student a certain conception of the quality and intensity of the
feeling or passion that pervades it; this is to be interpreted, as well as may be,
by the most appropriate vocal signs possible<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the whole constituting the vocal
expression suitable to the piece. In respect to its pervading emotion, the selection
will have what is called a <b>drift</b>, or general tendency, towards one of those
states described as characteristic of the diction of discourse, the diction of feeling,
and the diction of passion, respectively; and it is the business of the reader
to watch for this drift, which of course may vary from passage to passage, from
sentence to sentence, and sometimes from word to word, and to interpret it as
best he may.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>To indicate what modes of voice utterance are naturally most appropriate to
the expression of these various emotional states and drifts, it will be best to take
up, one by one, the different properties of the voice, and the several modes in
which they are manifested, and to state briefly, and in general terms, the emotional
state or drift of which it is an appropriate expression. (With respect to
quality and abruptness this will be sufficiently done indirectly.) The student
then must for himself, if he wishes to apply these results to the reading of any
selected passage, first by analysis ascertain what are the emotional states which
it involves, what are its prevailing drifts, then in respect to each property of the
voice choose the suitable mode for the interpretation of these several states or
drifts, conjoin the selected modes into appropriate vocal signs, and with these
form the vocal expression that suitably interprets the whole passage. <i>The
teacher, or the teacher and student together, should select from the</i> <span class="smcap">Reader</span>, <i>or
elsewhere, sentences or passages that fitly exemplify the different modes; these
should be written upon a black-board, or in some other way preserved, and be
referred to frequently for practice both in voice culture and in vocal interpretation.</i></p>


<p>I. <span class="smcap">Pitch</span>. Pitch must be considered under three heads: first, as referring to
the prevailing elevation of tone assumed by the voice in the reading of a whole
sentence, passage, or selection, called <i>general</i> or <i>sentential pitch</i>; second, as referring
to the degree of elevation assumed by the voice in the utterance of the
opening, or radical, of any syllable, called <i>initial</i> or <i>radical pitch</i>; third, as
referring to the tone-width of the intervals in the utterance of the syllable concrete.</p>

<p><b>Sentential Pitch</b> in its various modes is descriptive of the general position
in the scale taken by the tones of the voice in uttering a sentence or passage.
It may be spoken of as <i>medium</i>, <i>high</i>, and <i>low</i>. <b>Medium Pitch</b> should correspond
with the <i>normal pitch of discourse</i> previously described. It is natural to
the expression of all unimpassioned thought, and also of all emotions, except the
livelier, and the deeper and more intense. <b>High Pitch</b> and <b>Low Pitch</b> are only
relative terms. They do not represent fixed and definite modes of utterance;
and all that can be said is, that for the interpretation of what may be called the
lighter feelings and emotions, such as cheerfulness, joy, exultation, interest, and
so on, also for the expression of raillery, facetiousness, humorous conversation,
laughter, and the like, sentential pitch of a degree somewhat higher than normal
pitch is appropriate; and, on the other hand, for the interpretation of what may
be called the graver and deeper feelings, such as awe, reverence, humility, grief,
and melancholy, and the more impassioned emotions, as disgust, loathing, horror,
rage, despair, as well as for the expression of all very serious and impressive
thought, sentential pitch of a degree somewhat lower than normal pitch is
appropriate. The degree of elevation and depression must be determined by
the judgment and good taste of the reader; but it must be borne in mind that
this degree may vary from passage to passage, and from sentence to sentence,
and even from phrase to phrase.</p>

<p>In every style of diction, no matter how unimpassioned it may be, there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
be frequent changes in the train of thought, and frequent changes in the intensity
of feeling; to represent these changes there should be corresponding variations,
or <b>transitions in sentential pitch</b>. These transitions also serve another
purpose, namely, to indicate an interpolated or parenthetical idea. In making
transitions the voice follows the general law of all vocal interpretation; strong
contrasts in thought and feeling are marked by transitions of wide intervals, and
lesser contrasts by lesser intervals.</p>

<p><i>Transitions in pitch are naturally accompanied by corresponding changes in
force, rate of utterance, and phrasing</i>; and, like all other modes of expression,
these receive their color from the intensity of thought and feeling of which they
are the symbols. For example, in the rendering of a parenthetical clause (since, as
a rule, the thought expressed in the parenthesis is of less gravity than the thought
in the main sentence), the voice will manifest itself in lighter force and generally
in quicker movement, that is, in lighter, less contrasting colors; but whether
the pitch be raised or lowered depends upon the sentential pitch appropriate to
the main sentence,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it should be in contrast with that. And it may be remarked
in passing, that the reading of the parenthesis should end with a phrase melody
similar to that appropriate to the words immediately before the parenthesis, so
that the ear may naturally be carried back to the proper place in the main
clause for the continuation of the expression of the principal thought.</p>

<p><b>Radical Pitch</b>, that is the pitch with which the opening of a syllable is
uttered, is, in respect of appropriate employment, the most important element of
reading or speaking; but all that can be done here, is to call attention to this,
and leave the student to exercise his taste and judgment in regard to its use.
The importance of appropriately varying radical pitch so as to impart melody
to continued utterance will be seen at once if a simple sentence (for example,
"<i>Tom and Jim sat on a log</i>") be read, first in that monotonous voice (that is,
with unvarying radical pitch) so often heard in the labored reading of improperly
taught young children, and then with those appropriate intonations heard in
animated colloquy. When properly rendered, even if read with but little animation,
each syllable, or concrete, passes through an interval of a second, and
the several syllables are discretely uttered; but the <i>radical pitch varies from
syllable to syllable</i>, forming a diatonic melody. <i>For the rendering of any given
sentence in appropriate diatonic melody, positive direction as to the order of succession
in respect of radical pitch cannot be given</i>; the same words may be uttered
with equal appropriateness in many varieties of melody. The ignoring of this
fact has led to the most absurd pretensions.</p>

<p>A group of two or three syllabic concretes is called a <b>phrase of melody</b>; and
as phrases vary with respect to pitch, in the order of succession of the radicals
of their constituent syllables, they receive different names: such as the <i>monotone</i>,
in which the radicals are all on the same pitch; and the <i>ditone</i> and the
<i>tritone</i>, groups of two tones and three tones respectively, with radicals of different
pitch; and, again, the concretes in these phrases may have upward or
downward intonations: but fixed rules cannot be laid down for their use. The
reader must bear in mind, however, that it is upon the tasteful use of phrases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
and cadences, that is, upon the tasteful employment of variation in radical pitch,
that the melody of uttered language depends; and that if it be devoid of this
melody, it is both wearisome and unimpressive to the hearer.</p>

<p>The intonations of the voice must necessarily be through either rising intervals
or falling intervals, and there is a generic difference in the meaning of these.
<b>The rising interval</b> is heard naturally at the end of a direct question; that is,
one to which "<i>yes</i>" or "<i>no</i>" is an expected answer, as "<i>Are you going home?</i>"
The suspensive tone which the voice assumes at the end of the interrogation is
indicative of incompleteness of thought; and <i>indication of incompleteness is the
characteristic function of all rising intervals</i>.</p>

<p><b>The falling interval</b> is heard naturally at the close of a complete statement,
as "<i>I am here</i>"; and hence, <i>words indicating completeness, positiveness, resolution,
are appropriately uttered with downward intervals</i>. In effecting a downward
intonation the voice operates in one of two ways: either the <i>weaker mode</i>,
in which it descends from a radical pitch at or near the current tone to a lower
pitch; or the <i>stronger mode</i>, in which it assumes discretely a radical pitch as
much <i>above</i> the current tone as the emphasis requires, and descends concretely
either to the current tone or below it.</p>

<p>As every sentence is more or less incomplete until the end is reached, <i>rising
intervals are the rule in intonation, and falling intervals the exception</i>, and it
is this infrequency of use which gives to the falling movement its value as a
mode of emphasis. But where the emphasis is that of doubt, uncertainty, surprise,
or interrogation, the suspensiveness of these emotional states is appropriately
expressed by rising intonations; and hence, too, in all sentences in
which the interrogative element is strongly present, the rising interval should
characterize every syllable in it, and the sentences be uttered with interrogative
intonations throughout. If in any such sentence, a particular word is to be
especially emphasized, this is effected by giving to the word a low radical pitch
and retaining the rising interval indicative of interrogation.</p>

<p><b>The width of the interval</b> depends, as is natural, upon the intensity of the
thought or emotion of which the concrete is intended to be an expression. For
example, suppose the statement, "<b>You</b> <i>are the culprit</i>," be answered by the
surprised and indignant interrogation, "<b>I?</b>" The emphatic words here used
may be appropriately uttered with intervals of a tone, a third, a fifth, or an
octave, according to the emphasis supposed necessary.</p>

<p><b>The Semitone</b>, as has been said before, is an interval sometimes heard in
language of distress, complaint, grief, sorrow, tenderness, compassion, pity.
Occasionally it is introduced in diatonic melody as an appropriate emphatic
mode of uttering a single word; as, for example, "<i>Other friends have flown
before; on the morrow</i> <span class="smcap">he</span> <i>will leave me</i>." At times diction may assume what
may be called a <i>pathetic drift</i>, and for the suitable interpretation of this drift
semitonic intervals may be used, and the mode of progression cease for a space
to be diatonic and become semitonic, or <i>chromatic</i>, as it is called.</p>

<p><b>The Wave</b> is one of the most impressive of the elements of expression; but
its proper use demands great flexibility in the vocal organs and a high degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
taste in the reader. Like all other unusual modes, its employment lends color
and contrast to utterance; that is, it makes it more effective for the purposes of
emphasis or distinction. The wave, as has been described, is a concrete with
an upward and a downward movement united; but its last constituent is that
which most affects the ear and leaves upon it the stronger impression, and hence,
especially if it be given with a wide interval, <i>its dominant characteristic will
be that of the second movement</i>; for example, if the second movement be upward,
the wave may express interrogation mingled with surprise or scorn; if the
second movement be downward, the wave may express astonishment mingled
with indignation. The intervals which are given to the wave depend upon the
diction to which it is applied. To express great surprise or vehement indignation
it may sweep through a fifth or a whole octave. In these extreme modes
<i>the wave frequently is given a wider interval in the second movement than in
the first</i>, and its effect intensified by the appropriate use of stress, and (for the
expression of such emotions as scorn, contempt, irony, ridicule, and so on) of
the impure qualities of voice. When used with intervals of the second, the
characteristics of direct and inverted forms lose some of their distinctness; but
in this degree the wave is effectively used to put into relief occasional words, or,
with median stress and long quantities, to give to the otherwise short and tripping
character of the second a dignified and impressive effect suited to the rendering
of all serious and important diction that is not impassioned.</p>

<p><b>The Wave of the Semitone</b> is generally employed when time, or syllabic
quantity, is needed as an element in the expression of the language of complaint
or pathos. The effect is much the same whether it be direct or indirect.</p>

<p><b>The Tremor</b> may be used to express grief, supplication, tenderness, in which
the interval through which it ranges may be wide, or, for a more plaintive effect,
be limited to the semitone. With constituent intervals other than the semitone
(that is, of a tone or otherwise), and ranging through an aggregate interval of less
or greater width, it may be used to express laughter; as, for example, in the
utterance of the syllables "<i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>ha</i>," which, when rapidly effected,
resembles one syllable uttered with discrete intervals. Combined with stress,
aspiration, and guttural vibration, in suitable modifications, this laughing tone
may be made to express scorn, derision, exultation, triumph, and so on.</p>


<p>II. <span class="smcap">Force</span>. Force must be considered under two aspects: first, as to the <i>degree
of its intensity</i> in the utterance of syllables, words, phrases, and sentences;
and second, as to the <i>form of its application in the utterance of the concrete</i>.
When the term is used without qualification, the first of these considerations is
intended; when the second is intended, force is generally spoken of as <b>stress</b>.</p>

<p><i>Force must be contradistinguished from loudness.</i> In mere loudness the vocal
organs are comparatively relaxed<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the intensity of sound being produced by the
violent discharge of a great volume of air from the lungs. In forceful utterance
the vocal organs are compressed and tense, and though the volume of air effused
be small, the resulting sound-vibrations are strong, and distinct, and of
penetrating power.</p>

<p>In respect of intensity, force may be manifested in infinite variation, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
degrees usually spoken of are <i>very light</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>moderate</i>, <i>strong</i>, and <i>very strong</i>.
As with all other modes, these degrees will vary from word to word, and from
sentence to sentence; and great judgment and taste must be exercised in employing
them, so that they appropriately represent the intensity of the thought
and feeling of which they are to be the expression.</p>

<p><b>Moderate Force</b> is the natural expression of tranquillity, and, therefore, of all
unimpassioned diction. As the diction becomes pervaded by the more positive
emotions, the tones of the voice naturally become stronger. Certainty requires
strong force with pure quality. So all the passions, the lighter as well as the
more vehement, require the degree of force to be heightened: cheerfulness, joy,
ecstacy, requiring force moderately strong; and anger, hate, terror, revenge,
being suitably rendered by very strong force. Again, doubt, uncertainty, secrecy,
as well as the gentler and more plaintive emotions, are most suitably represented
by the lighter shades of force.</p>

<p>As the voice assumes the intenser modes of force, the vocal organs become
more and more compressed, and utterance is more and more labored; the breath
forced out cannot all be vocalized; the voice becomes less and less pure, and
manifests itself in the aspirate and guttural qualities. <i>Hence, strongly suppressed
utterance in impure vocality, rather than mere loudness in pure vocality, is the
appropriate expression for all the intenser passions.</i></p>


<p>III. <span class="smcap">Stress</span>. Stress is force considered with respect of the form of its application
to the concrete. Since the equable concrete is the natural colorless expression
of unimpassioned thought, force applied to any part of it changes its
character, and gives it a more or less significant emphasis. The three most
usual forms of stress are the <i>radical</i>, the <i>median</i>, and the <i>final</i>; these may be
effected in any of the degrees of force. <i>Compound stress</i> and <i>thorough stress</i>
admit of but little variation.</p>

<p><b>Radical Stress</b>, to some extent an essential, but not an expressive element in
the equable concrete, is, in a somewhat stronger form, an element in all utterance
that is intended to be vivid and energetic, emphasizing these characteristics
by its own incisive clearness. The more animated and energetic the diction the
clearer and more determined should be the opening of the concrete, that is, the
more distinct and forcible should be its radical stress; while in graver language
the radical stress is less pronounced. In its emphatic degree it ought at no
time to be allowed to become a current mode, imparting its peculiar incisive
character to every syllable; though, for especial emphasis, it may be appropriately
used in this way in the utterance of the several words of a phrase.</p>

<p><b>Final Stress</b> differs from radical stress principally in this, that while it equally
indicates energy and positiveness, it does so as in accordance with predetermination
and reflection. <i>Radical stress denotes, as it were, an involuntary
state of energy; final stress, the energy or fixedness of resolve.</i> Hence, final
stress is appropriate to the expression of resolution, of obstinacy, of earnest
conviction, of passionate resolve. It emphasizes the characteristics of wide
intervals, giving to rising intonations a more decidedly interrogatory character,
and making falling intonations more vehemently and passionately positive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span><b>Median Stress</b>, as it can be effectively applied to none but indefinite or
mutable syllables, is compatible only with such a rate of utterance as will permit
of these receiving long quantities. It may receive any degree of force, from
that gentle swell which indicates a tranquil flow of emotion, to that firm and
swelling energy which is the appropriate expression of the language of elevated
feeling. With the wider intervals it should be used only for occasional emphasis;
but in its lighter forms it may prevail as a drift of dignified expression.
Median stress, being always necessarily associated with long quantity in syllables,
is not an appropriate mode in the language of colloquy, or in vivacious discourse
of any kind. It is, however, the fit interpreter of that fervid and lofty
imagination which clothes itself in forms of grace and grandeur; and hence,
with intonations and waves of the lesser intervals, with medium or low sentential
pitch, a moderate degree of force, and the pure or orotund quality, it is the
appropriate expression of all exalted prose and poetry, not strongly dramatic.</p>

<p><b>Thorough Stress</b> is effected by continuing the force and fulness of the radical
stress throughout the whole concrete. Used as a current mode, which
should be but rarely, it is expressive of bluntness, arrogance, bravado; and,
with short quantities, of ignorant coarseness. Occasionally it may be used instead
of final stress to give emphasis to a syllable whose vanishing movement is
but little capable of receiving an increase of force.</p>

<p><b>Compound Stress</b> combines the qualities of both radical and final stress; it
is therefore of extreme character, and can be only occasionally used. With
wide intervals, in its stronger modes, it is expressive of the utmost intensity
of feeling; in its lighter modes it is the natural expression of strong surprise.</p>

<p><b>The Loud Concrete</b> is simply the equable concrete uttered with greater fulness
of breath and loudness of tone. It is used to break a current of light force
for the sake of emphasizing some word or phrase; and, in impassioned discourse,
it may be used as a current mode, individual words or phrases being then put in
relief by receiving the forcible radical, or thorough, or compound stress.</p>

<p>In reference to stress it must be remembered that, as with all other varieties
of emphatic utterance, no one form should prevail as an exclusive mode. Even
a prevalent drift of thought or feeling will be most effectively rendered by vocal
signs which change in color and intensity from word to word. It must also be
borne in mind in reference both to force and stress, and to pitch and time as well,
that the modes which are employed must sustain a suitable relation to the situation
and surroundings of the speaker. Where considerable space has to be
filled and distance overcome, the energy of utterance should be correspondingly
intense; but for great distances, what is called <b>level speaking</b> is the only effectual
mode,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is, speaking exclusively in those tones of normal pitch in which
the voice has most penetrating power, with force of almost constant intensity,
and in a somewhat slow movement with long syllabic quantities, but of course
with as much needful variation of expression as is possible within these limits.</p>


<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Time</span>. Time is rate of utterance. It comprehends <i>quantity</i>, or rate considered
in reference to the duration of individual syllables; and <i>movement</i>, or
rate considered in reference to the utterance of syllables and words in succession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
With it may be considered <i>pauses</i>, or cessations of the voice, helpful in the expression
of thought and feeling, and necessary to the working of the vocal
mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Quantity</b>, as defined above, is an arbitrary thing, dependent almost entirely
upon the will of the speaker. But many words and syllables are more expressive
of their meaning when, in uttering them, the voice is somewhat prolonged,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>hence
<i>quantity is an element of expression</i>. Again, many words and syllables
can receive this prolongation of utterance more readily than others,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>hence
<i>quantity is a natural element of spoken language</i>. As indefinite syllables are
much more capable of prolongation than mutable or immutable syllables, they
are said to possess long quantity, or, more shortly, "to possess quantity";
mutable syllables possess quantity in a less degree, and immutable syllables are
naturally deficient in quantity.</p>

<p>As an element of expression, quantity (that is, long quantity) lends dignity and
grace to the movement of the voice, and affords ground for the display of those
expressive modes of vocal action which are incompatible with the rapid or ejaculatory
utterance of the concrete; and hence, with median stress, the wave,
moderate intervals, medium or low sentential pitch, it is used as naturally interpretative
of solemnity, reverence, awe, deep pathos, ardent admiration, and
all elevated emotion. Colloquial tones, excited argument, wit, raillery, and all
the lighter emotions, require for their expression, brilliancy rather than grace,
and so are more fittingly interpreted by short quantities and radical stress.</p>

<p>The discerning reader, in his work of vocal interpretation, will not fail to take
advantage of the inherent character of syllables with respect to quantity. Our
language abounds in indefinite syllables to which he may impart whatever quantity
he may desire. On the other hand, immutable syllables, while not admitting
the wave and the median stress, are eminently fitted to receive the more
forcible forms of radical stress; and mutable syllables, with their abrupt closes,
permit of perfect exemplifications of thorough and final stress.</p>

<p><b>Movement</b>, though it depends for its slower and more expressive forms upon
the capacities of syllables for the reception of long quantities, is, in its more
rapid forms, quite independent of syllabic structure, and dependent only on the
will of the speaker; hence it may be spoken of as being altogether under his
control. A medium rate of utterance is, with respect to time, the natural expression
of an equable flow of thought. The livelier emotions should be indicated
by quicker rates, and hence, cheerfulness, joy, vivacious dialogue, animated
narration, naturally find their expression in movements more or less brisk, with
short quantities, varied intonations, and pitch higher than the normal; the
more vehement emotions, eagerness, anger, excited anxiety, demand simply
heightened forms of these modes. Contrariwise, thought of grave and meditative
character, admiration, reverence, and all the deeper and calmer feelings,
require a deliberative, slow-timed utterance, with long quantities for accented
syllables, and extended time for even unaccented syllables. As these serious
emotions become stronger and deeper, the syllabic quantities become proportionately
longer, and with impressive median swells, orotund quality, low pitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
waves and simple intonations of the second, frequent phrases in monotone, and
an occasional tremor, constitute the most impressive utterance of adoration.</p>

<p><i>Occasionally an abrupt change in quantity, or movement, may be employed as
a mode of emphasis</i>, either positive or negative; for example, in a current of
rapid movement, a word may be put into strong relief by being uttered with
quantity much extended; contrariwise, a parenthetical or explanatory phrase
is usually touched upon lightly and with a more rapid movement than that of
the current in which it is found.</p>

<p><b>Pause</b> <i>may be used as an element in the expression of thought simply, that is,
as a help to the interpretation of the mere sense of the words read</i>; or, <i>more
emphatically, as an element in the expression of feeling and emotion</i>. As interpretative
of thought, pauses should correspond mainly with the graphical marks
of punctuation. Two things, however, must be borne in mind: <i>first</i>, the use of
punctuation marks in writing and in printing is always more or less an arbitrary
matter, scarcely any two authors agreeing in their employment of them; and
therefore the reader's own good sense must be to him his principal authority as
to the closeness with which he follows them: and <i>second</i>, pauses are to an auditor
what punctuation marks are intended to be to a reader; but, whereas the
eye may constantly keep within its vision the relation of each word uttered, both
to those which preceded it and to those which are to follow, the ear hears the
words that are read only <i>ictus</i> by <i>ictus</i>, stroke by stroke, and therefore can not
aid the mind to grasp this relation<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the memory alone helping to do that; and
hence, in reading, pauses should be more frequent, and perhaps more prolonged,
than the punctuation marks might seem to necessitate. The reader
should also bear in mind that even the plainest and simplest diction, or that requiring
the most rapid utterance, may be so marked by appropriate pauses that
those stoppages of the voice necessarily required for inspiration, shall never
occur except when they assist to interpret the sense,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they must not interrupt it.</p>

<p>As interpretative of emotion pauses do not necessarily correspond to grammatical
structure; but, as with all the modes of expression previously considered,
their frequency and length<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>their only modifications<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>must harmonize with the
feeling which they are to assist in interpreting. In length, for example, they
should correspond with the movement of which they may be said to form a part;
when the movement is slow, as in the expression of awe, reverence, and the like,
they are naturally long; in the brisk movement required to interpret the livelier
emotions, they should be short. As a mode of emphasis pause serves to fix the
attention of the hearer,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>either <i>backward</i> upon a word or phrase, that the mind
may dwell upon it, or <i>forward</i> to awaken curiosity and expectation: it is evident
then that a frequent use of it for this purpose would destroy its value.</p>

<p><i>Pauses may be used in reading to simulate an appropriate labor of utterance</i>,
as when the mind is supposed to be overcome by sorrow, or disturbed by anger.
At such times also, they serve as fit rests for the voice in its efforts to express
the disturbed condition of the mind, and as appropriate avenues for the escape of
emotion otherwise than by vocality, as by sibling. <i>Pauses should be used also
to indicate sudden transitions from one state of caution to another.</i></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all
the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' houses
of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem,
to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> out
of the city of David, which is Zion. And all the men
of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at
the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh
month. And all the elders of Israel came, and the
priests took up the ark. And they brought up the ark
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy
vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests
and the Levites bring up. And king Solomon and all
the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto
him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to
the most holy place, even under the wings of the
cherubim. For the cherubim spread forth their wings
over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ark and the staves thereof above. There was nothing
in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put
there at Horeb, when the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made a covenant with
the children of Israel, when they came out of the land
of Egypt. And it came to pass, when the priests were
come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, so that the priests could not stand
to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p>Then spake Solomon, The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath said that he
would dwell in the thick darkness. I have surely built
thee an house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in
for ever. And the king turned his face about, and
blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the
congregation of Israel stood. And he said, Blessed be
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, which spake with his
mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
fulfilled it, saying, Since the day that I brought forth
my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of
all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name
might be there; but I chose David to be over my people
Israel. Now it was in the heart of David my father to
build an house for the name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God
of Israel. But the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto David my father,
Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house for
my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart:
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
house for my name. And the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath established
his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room
of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> promised, and have built the house for the
name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. And there have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, which he made with our fathers, when he brought
them out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>And Solomon stood before the altar of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> in
the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread
forth his hands toward heaven: and he said, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven
above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and
mercy with thy servants, that walk before thee with all
their heart: who hast kept with thy servant David my
father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou
spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine
hand, as it is this day. Now therefore, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God
of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that
which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not
fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel;
if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk
before me as thou hast walked before me. Now therefore,
O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my
father. But will God in very deed dwell on the earth?
behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee; how much less this house that I have builded!
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and
to his supplication, O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> my God, to hearken unto the
cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before
thee this day: that thine eyes may be open toward this
house night and day, even toward the place whereof
thou hast said, My name shall be there: to hearken unto
the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this
place. And hearken thou to the supplication of thy
servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray
toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
place: and when thou hearest, forgive. If a man sin
against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to
cause him to swear, and he come and swear before thine
altar in this house: then hear thou in heaven, and do,
and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring
his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous,
to give him according to his righteousness. When thy
people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to
thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication
unto thee in this house: then hear thou in heaven,
and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them
again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because
they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward
this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their
sin, when thou dost afflict them: then hear thou in
heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy
people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way
wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land,
which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if
there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpiller; if
their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities;
whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; what
prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or
by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the
plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands
toward this house: then hear thou in heaven thy
dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every
man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest;
(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the
children of men;) that they may fear thee all the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our
fathers. Moreover concerning the stranger, that is not of
thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country
for thy name's sake; (for they shall hear of thy great
name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thy stretched out
arm:) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according
to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all the
peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as
doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that
this house which I have built is called by thy name. If
thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by
whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> toward the city which thou hast chosen,
and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
and maintain their cause. If they sin against thee,
(for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry
with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they
carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy,
far off or near; yet if they shall bethink themselves in
the land whither they are carried captive, and turn
again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of
them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned,
and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly; if
they return unto thee with all their heart and with all
their soul in the land of their enemies, which carried
them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land,
which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou
hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy
name: then hear thou their prayer and their supplication
in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause;
and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed
against thee; and give them compassion before
those who carried them captive, that they may have
compassion on them: for they be thy people, and thine
inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt,
from the midst of the furnace of iron: that thine eyes
may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and
unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken
unto them whensoever they cry unto thee. For thou
didst separate them from among all the peoples of the
earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the
hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our
fathers out of Egypt, O Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end
of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he arose from before the altar of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, from
kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward
heaven. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation
of Israel with a loud voice, saying, Blessed be the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to
all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of
all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of
Moses his servant. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God be with us, as
he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor
forsake us: that he may incline our hearts unto him, to
walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded
our fathers. And let these my words, wherewith I have
made supplication before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, be nigh unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> our God day and night, that he maintain the cause
of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as
every day shall require: that all the peoples of the earth
may know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, he is God; there is none else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Let your heart therefore be perfect with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our
God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments,
as at this day. And the king, and all Israel with
him, offered sacrifice before the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> What, is Antonio here?</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> Ready, so please your grace.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer<br />
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch<br />
Uncapable of pity, void and empty<br />
From any dram of mercy.</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i><span style="padding-left: 9em;">I have heard</span><br />
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify<br />
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>And that no lawful means can carry me<br />
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose<br />
My patience to his fury; and am arm'd<br />
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,<br />
The very tyranny and rage of his.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</p>

<p><i>Solanio.</i> He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span  class="smcap">Shylock</span>.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Make room, and let him stand before our face.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<br />
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice<br />
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought<br />
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange<br />
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<br />
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<br />
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,<br />
Forgive a moiety of the principal;<br />
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,<br />
That have of late so huddled on his back,<br />
Enough to press a royal merchant down<br />
And pluck commiseration of his state<br />
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<br />
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd<br />
To offices of tender courtesy.<br />
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;<br />
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br />
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:<br />
If you deny it, let the danger light<br />
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.<br />
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have<br />
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Three thousand ducats; I'll not answer that;<br />
But, say, it is my humor; is it answer'd?<br />
What if my house be troubled with a rat,<br />
And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats<br />
To have it ban'd? What, are you answer'd yet?<br />
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<br />
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;<br />
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,<br />
Cannot contain themselves: for affection,<br />
Master of passion, sways it to the mood<br />
Of what it likes, or loathes. Now, for your answer:<br />
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,<br />
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;<br />
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;<br />
Why he, a woollen bagpipe,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but of force<br />
Must yield to such inevitable shame<br />
As to offend, himself being offended;<br />
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br />
More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing<br />
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br />
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?</p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<br />
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> I am not bound to please thee with my answer.</p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> Do all men kill the things they do not love?</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> Every offence is not a hate at first.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> What, would'st thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> I pray you, think you question with the Jew.<br />
You may as well go stand upon the beach,<br />
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<br />
You may as well use question with the wolf,<br />
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<br />
You may as well forbid the mountain pines<br />
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;<br />
You may as well do anything most hard,<br />
As seek to soften that<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>than which what's harder?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,<br />
Make no more offers, use no further means,<br />
But, with all brief and plain conveniency,<br />
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.</p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> If every ducat in six thousand ducats<br />
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,<br />
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<br />
You have among you many a purchas'd slave,<br />
Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,<br />
You use in abject and in slavish parts,<br />
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,<br />
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?<br />
Why sweat they under burdens? let their beds<br />
Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates<br />
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer,<br />
"The slaves are ours:" so do I answer you:<br />
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,<br />
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine, and I will have it:<br />
If you deny me, fie upon your law!<br />
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<br />
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Upon my power I may dismiss this court,<br />
Unless Bellario, a learn<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d doctor,<br />
Whom I have sent for to determine this,<br />
Come here to-day.</p>

<p><i>Solanio.</i><span style="padding-left: 6em;">My lord, here stays without</span><br />
A messenger with letters from the doctor,<br />
New come from Padua.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Bring us the letters; call the messenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><i>Bassanio.</i> Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!<br />
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,<br />
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> I am a tainted wether of the flock,<br />
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit<br />
Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me:<br />
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,<br />
Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nerissa</span>, <i>dressed like a lawyer's clerk.</i></p>

<span class="right">[<i>Presents a letter.</i></span><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.</p>

<p><i>Gratiano.</i> Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,<br />
Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,<br />
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness<br />
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</p>
<p><i>Shylock.</i> No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</p>
<p><i>Gratiano.</i> O, be thou damn'd, inexorable dog!<br />
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.<br />
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,<br />
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,<br />
That souls of animals infuse themselves<br />
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit<br />
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,<br />
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,<br />
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,<br />
Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires<br />
Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd, and ravenous.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,<br />
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:<br />
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.<br />
<i>Duke.</i> This letter from Bellario doth commend<br />
A young and learn<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d doctor to our court:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Where is he?</p>

To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.</p>
<p><i>Duke.</i> With all my heart.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Some three or four of you<br />
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.<br />
</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>[Clerk reads.] <i>Your grace shall understand, that, at the receipt
of your letter, I am very sick: but, in the instant that your
messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor
of Rome; his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the
cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant:
we turned o'er many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion: which, bettered with his own learning, the greatness
whereof I cannot enough commend, comes with him, at my importunity,
to fill up your grace's request in my stead. I beseech
you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a
reverend estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial
shall better publish his commendation.</i></p>

<p>Give me your hand: came you from old Bellario?</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> I did, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i><span style="padding-left: 8em;">You are welcome; take your place.</span><br />
Are you acquainted with the difference<br />
That holds this present question in the court?</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> I am inform<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d, throughly of the cause.<br />
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</p>

<p><i>Duke.</i> Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Is your name Shylock?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><i>Shylock.</i><span style="padding-left: 11em;">Shylock is my name.</span></p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;<br />
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br />
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
You stand within his danger, do you not?<span class="right smcap">[<i>To</i> Antonio</span>.</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> Ay, so he says.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i><span style="padding-left: 9em;">Do you confess the bond?</span></p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i><span style="padding-left: 3.5em;">Then must the Jew be merciful.</span></p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> The quality of mercy is not strain'd;<br />
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;<br />
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:<br />
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<br />
The thron<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d monarch better than his crown;<br />
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br />
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br />
It is enthron<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d in the hearts of kings,<br />
It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br />
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br />
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br />
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br />
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br />
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br />
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br />
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br />
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</p>
<p><i>Shylock.</i> My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br />
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Is he not able to discharge the money?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><i>Bassanio.</i> Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;<br />
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,<br />
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,<br />
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<br />
If this will not suffice, it must appear<br />
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,<br />
Wrest once the law to your authority:<br />
To do a great right, do a little wrong;<br />
And curb this cruel devil of his will.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> It must not be; there is no power in Venice<br />
Can alter a decree establish<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d:<br />
'Twill be recorded for a precedent;<br />
And many an error, by the same example,<br />
Will rush into the state. It cannot be.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!<br />
O wise young judge, how do I honour thee!</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:<br />
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br />
No, not for Venice.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i><span style="padding-left: 6em;">Why, this bond is forfeit;</span><br />
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br />
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br />
Nearest the merchant's heart.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Be merciful;<br />
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> When it is paid according to the tenor.<br />
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br />
You know the law, your exposition<br />
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,<br />
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br />
Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear<br />
There is no power in the tongue of man<br />
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> Most heartily I do beseech the court<br />
To give the judgment.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i><span style="padding: 8em;">Why, then, thus it is:</span><br />
You must prepare your bosom for his knife;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> O noble judge! O excellent young man!</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>For the intent and purpose of the law<br />
Hath full relation to the penalty,<br />
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</p>
<p><i>Shylock.</i> 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!<br />
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</p>
<p><i>Portia.</i> Therefore, lay bare your bosom.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i><span style="padding-left: 16em;">Ay, his breast:</span><br />
So says the bond:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>doth it not, noble judge?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
"Nearest his heart:" those are the very words.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> It is so. Are there balance here, to weigh<br />
The flesh?</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> I have them ready.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<br />
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> Is it so nominated in the bond?</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> It is not so express'd; but what of that?<br />
'Twere good you do so much for charity.</p>

<p><i>Shylock.</i> I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.</p>

<p><i>Portia.</i> Come, merchant, have you anything to say?</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> But little: I am arm'd, and well prepar'd.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!<br />
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<br />
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br />
Than is her custom: it is still her use<br />
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br />
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br />
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<br />
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.<br />
Commend me to your honorable wife:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Tell her the process of Antonio's end;<br />
Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;<br />
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br />
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br />
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,<br />
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br />
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br />
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Bassanio.</i> Antonio, I am married to a wife<br />
Which is as dear to me as life itself;<br />
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">Lord Bacon</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1561-1626.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Essays</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a trivial grammar-school text, but yet worthy a
wise man's consideration: question was asked of Demosthenes,
what was the chief part of an orator? He answered,
action: what next? action: what next again? action.
He said it that knew it best, and had by nature himself
no advantage in that he commended. A strange thing,
that that part of an orator which is but superficial, and
rather the virtue of a player, should be placed so high
above those other noble parts, of invention, elocution,
and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it were all in all.
But the reason is plain. There is in human nature generally
more of the fool than of the wise; and therefore
those faculties by which the foolish part of men's minds is
taken, are most potent. Wonderful like is the case of
boldness in civil business; what first? boldness: what
second and third? boldness. And yet boldness is a child
of ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts: but,
nevertheless, it doth fascinate, and bind hand and foot
those that are either shallow in judgment or weak in
courage, which are the greatest part; yea, and prevaileth
with wise men at weak times; therefore we see it hath
done wonders in popular states, but with senates and
princes less; and more, ever upon the first entrance of
bold persons into action, than soon after; for boldness is
an ill keeper of promise. Surely, as there are mountebanks
for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for
the politic body<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>men that undertake great cures, and
perhaps have been lucky in two or three experiments, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
want the grounds of science, and therefore cannot hold
out. Nay, you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet's
miracle. Mahomet made the people believe that
he would call a hill to him, and from the top of it offer
up his prayers for the observers of his law. The people
assembled: Mahomet called the hill to come to him
again and again; and when the hill stood still, he was
never a whit abashed, but said, "If the hill will not come
to Mahomet, Mahomet will go to the hill." So these men,
when they have promised great matters, and failed most
shamefully, yet, if they have the perfection of boldness,
they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and no more
ado. Certainly, to men of great judgment, bold persons
are sport to behold; nay, and to the vulgar also boldness
hath somewhat of the ridiculous: for, if absurdity
be the subject of laughter, doubt you not but great boldness
is seldom without some absurdity; especially it is a
sport to see when a bold fellow is out of countenance,
for that puts his face into a most shrunken and wooden
posture, as needs it must<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for in bashfulness the spirits
do a little go and come<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but with bold men, upon like
occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at chess, where
it is no mate, but yet the game cannot stir: but this last
were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation.
This is well to be weighed, that boldness is ever blind,
for it seeth not dangers and inconveniences: therefore it
is ill in counsel, good in execution; so that the right use
of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but
be seconds, and under the direction of others; for in
counsel it is good to see dangers, and in execution not to
see them, except they be very great.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jeremy Taylor</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1613-1667.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Holy Living</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Virtues</span> and discourses are, like friends, necessary in
all fortunes; but those are the best, which are friends in
our sadnesses, and support us in our sorrows and sad accidents:
and in this sense, no man that is virtuous can be
friendless; nor hath any man reason to complain of the
Divine Providence, or accuse the public disorder of things,
or in his own infelicity, since God hath appointed one
remedy for all the evils in the world, and that is a contented
spirit: for this alone makes a man pass through
fire, and not be scorched; through seas, and not be
drowned; through hunger and nakedness, and want
nothing. For since all the evil in the world consists in
the disagreeing between the object and the appetite, as
when a man hath what he desires not, or desires what he
hath not, or desires amiss; he that composes his spirit to
the present accident, hath variety of instances for his
virtue, but none to trouble him, because his desires enlarge
not beyond his present fortune: and a wise man is
placed in the variety of chances, like the nave or centre
of a wheel, in the midst of all the circumvolutions and
changes of posture, without violence or change, save that
it turns gently in compliance with its changed parts, and
is indifferent which part is up, and which is down; for
there is some virtue or other to be exercised, whatever
happens, either patience or thanksgiving, love or fear,
moderation or humility, charity or contentedness, and
they are every one of them equally in order to his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
end and immortal felicity: and beauty is not made by
white or red, by black eyes and a round face, by a straight
body and a smooth skin; but by a proportion to the
fancy. No rules can make amiability; our minds and
apprehensions make that: and so is our felicity; and we
may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we
suffer contentedness and the grace of God to make the
proportions. For no man is poor that does not think himself
so: but if, in a full fortune, with impatience he desires
more, he proclaims his wants and his beggarly condition.
But because this grace of contentedness was the sum of all
the old moral philosophy, and a great duty in Christianity,
and of most universal use in the whole course of our
lives, and the only instrument to ease the burdens of the
world and the enmities of sad chances, it will not be amiss
to press it by the proper arguments by which God hath
bound it upon our spirits; it being fastened by reason
and religion, by duty and interest, by necessity and conveniency,
by example, and by the proposition of excellent
rewards, no less than peace and felicity.</p>

<p>Contentedness in all estates is a duty of religion; it
is the great reasonableness of complying with the Divine
Providence, which governs all the world, and hath so
ordered us in the administration of his great family.
He were a strange fool that should be angry because dogs
and sheep need no shoes, and yet himself is full of care
to get some. God hath supplied those needs to them by
natural provisions, and to thee by an artificial: for he
hath given thee reason to learn a trade, or some means to
make or buy them, so that it only differs in the manner
of our provision: and which had you rather want, shoes
or reason? and my patron, that hath given me a farm, is
freer to me than if he gives a loaf ready baked. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
however, all these gifts come from him, and therefore it
is fit he should dispense them as he pleases; and if we
murmur here, we may, at the next melancholy, be
troubled that God did not make us to be angels or stars.
For if that which we are or have do not content us, we
may be troubled for every thing in the world which is
beside our being or our possessions.</p>

<p>God is the master of the scenes; we must not choose
which part we shall act; it concerns us only to be careful
that we do it well, always saying, "If this please God, let
it be as it is:" and we, who pray that God's will may be
done in earth as it is in heaven, must remember that the
angels do whatsoever is commanded them, and go wherever
they are sent, and refuse no circumstances; and if their
employment be crossed by a higher decree, they sit down
in peace, and rejoice in the event; and when the angel of
Judea could not prevail in behalf of the people committed
to his charge, because the angel of Persia opposed it, he
only told the story at the command of God, and was as
content, and worshipped with as great an ecstasy in his
proportion, as the prevailing spirit. Do thou so likewise:
keep the station where God hath placed you, and you
shall never long for things without, but sit at home, feasting
upon the Divine Providence and thy own reason, by
which we are taught that it is necessary and reasonable
to submit to God.</p>

<p>For is not all the world God's family? Are not we
his creatures? Are we not as clay in the hand of the
potter? Do we not live upon his meat, and move by
his strength, and do our work by his light? Are we
any thing but what we are from him? And shall there
be a mutiny among the flocks and herds, because their
lord or their shepherd chooses their pastures, and suffers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them not to wander into deserts and unknown ways? If
we choose, we do it so foolishly that we cannot like it
long, and most commonly not at all: but God, who can
do what he pleases, is wise to choose safely for us, affectionate
to comply with our needs, and powerful to execute
all his wise decrees. Here, therefore, is the wisdom
of the contented man, to let God choose for him; for
when we have given up our wills to him, and stand in
that station of the battle where our great General hath
placed us, our spirits must needs rest while our conditions
have for their security the power, the wisdom, and the
charity of God.</p>

<p>Contentedness in all accidents brings great peace of
spirit, and is the great and only instrument of temporal
felicity. It removes the sting from the accident, and
makes a man not to depend upon chance and the uncertain
dispositions of men for his well-being, but only on
God and his own spirit. We ourselves make our fortunes
good or bad; and when God lets loose a tyrant upon us,
or a sickness, or scorn, or a lessened fortune, if we fear to
die, or know not to be patient, or are proud or covetous,
then the calamity sits heavy on us. But if we know how
to manage a noble principle, and fear not death so much
as a dishonest action, and think impatience a worse evil
than a fever, and pride to be the biggest disgrace, and
poverty to be infinitely desirable before the torments of
covetousness; then we who now think vice to be so easy,
and make it so familiar, and think the cure so impossible,
shall quickly be of another mind, and reckon these
accidents amongst things eligible.</p>

<p>But no man can be happy that hath great hopes and
great fears of things without, and events depending upon
other men, or upon the chances of fortune. The rewards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of virtue are certain, and our provisions for our natural
support are certain; or if we want meat till we die, then
we die of that disease<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and there are many worse than
to die with an atrophy or consumption, or unapt and
coarser nourishment. But he that suffers a transporting
passion concerning things within the power of others, is
free from sorrow and amazement no longer than his
enemy shall give him leave; and it is ten to one but he
shall be smitten then and there where it shall most trouble
him; for so the adder teaches us where to strike, by her
curious and fearful defending of her head. The old
Stoics, when you told them of a sad story, would still
answer, "<i>What is that to me?</i>" Yes, for the tyrant hath
sentenced you also to prison. Well, what is that? He
will put a chain upon my leg; but he cannot bind my
soul. No; but he will kill you. Then I will die. If
presently, let me go, that I may presently be freer than
himself: but if not till anon, or to-morrow, I will dine
first, or sleep, or do what reason or nature calls for, as at
other times. This, in Gentile philosophy, is the same
with the discourse of St. Paul, "I have learned, in whatsoever
state I am, therewith to be content. I know both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
where and in all things I am instructed, both to be full
and to be hungry; both to abound and suffer need."</p>

<p>We are in the world like men playing at tables; the
chance is not in our power, but to play it is; and when
it is fallen we must manage it as we can: and let nothing
trouble us, but when we do a base action, or speak like
a fool, or think wickedly,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>these things God hath put
into our powers; but concerning those things which are
wholly in the choice of another, they cannot fall under
our deliberation, and therefore neither are they fit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
our passions. My fear may make me miserable, but it
cannot prevent what another hath in his power and purpose;
and prosperities can only be enjoyed by them who
fear not at all to lose them; since the amazement and
passion concerning the future takes off all the pleasure
of the present possession. Therefore, if thou hast lost
thy land, do not also lose thy constancy; and if thou
must die a little sooner, yet do not die impatiently. For
no chance is evil to him that is content: and to a man
nothing is miserable unless it be unreasonable. No man
can make another man to be his slave unless he hath
first enslaved himself to life and death, to pleasure or
pain, to hope or fear: command these passions, and you
are freer than the Parthian kings.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>O my good master, this morning walk has
been spent to my great pleasure and wonder; but I pray,
when shall I have your direction how to make artificial
flies, like to those that the trout loves best, and also how
to use them?</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>My honest scholar, it is now past five of the
clock; we will fish till nine, and then go to breakfast. Go
you to yon sycamore-tree, and hide your bottle of drink
under the hollow root of it; for about that time, and in
that place, we will make a brave breakfast with a piece
of powdered beef, and a radish or two, that I have in my
fish-bag: we shall, I warrant you, make a good, honest,
wholesome, hungry breakfast, and I will then give you
direction for the making and using of your flies; and in
the meantime, there is your rod and line, and my advice
is, that you fish as you see me do, and let's try which
can catch the first fish.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I thank you, master; I will observe and
practise your direction as far as I am able.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Look you, scholar, you see I have hold of
a good fish: I now see it is a trout. I pray put that net
under him, and touch not my line, for if you do, then
we break all. Well done, scholar! I thank you.</p>

<p>Now for another. Trust me, I have another bite:
come, scholar, come, lay down your rod, and help me to
land this as you did the other. So now we shall be
sure to have a good dish for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I am glad of that; but I have no fortune:
sure, master, yours is a better rod and better tackling.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Nay, then, take mine; and I will fish with
yours. Look you, scholar, I have another. Come, do
as you did before. And now I have a bite at another.
Oh me! he has broke all: there's half a line and a good
hook lost.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Ay, and a good trout too.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Nay, the trout is not lost; for pray take
notice, no man can lose what he never had.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Master, I can neither catch with the first
nor second angle: I have no fortune.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Look you, scholar, I have yet another.
And now, having caught two brace of trouts, I will tell
you a short tale as we walk towards our breakfast. A
scholar, a preacher I should say, that was to preach to
procure the approbation of a parish that he might be
their lecturer, had got from his fellow-pupil the copy of
a sermon that was first preached with great commendation
by him that composed it; and though the borrower
of it preached it, word for word, as it was at first, yet it
was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to
his congregation; which the sermon borrower complained
of to the lender of it; and thus was answered: "I lent
you, indeed, my fiddle, but not my fiddle-stick; for you
are to know, that every one cannot make music with my
words, which are fitted to my own mouth." And so, my
scholar, you are to know, that as the ill pronunciation or
ill accenting of words in a sermon spoils it, so the ill
carriage of your line, or not fishing even to a foot in a
right place, makes you lose your labor; and you are to
know, that though you have my fiddle, that is, my very
rod and tacklings with which you see I catch fish, yet you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
have not my fiddle-stick, that is, you yet have not skill
to know how to carry your hand and line, nor how to
guide it to a right place; and this must be taught you;
for you are to remember, I told you angling is an art,
either by practice or a long observation, or both. But
take this for a rule: when you fish for a trout with a
worm, let your line have so much and not more lead
than will fit the stream in which you fish; that is to say,
more in a great troublesome stream than in a smaller
that is quieter; as near as may be, so much as will sink
the bait to the bottom, and keep it still in motion, and
not more.</p>

<p>But now let's say grace and fall to breakfast. What
say you, scholar, to the providence of an old angler? does
not this meat taste well? and was not this place well
chosen to eat it? for this sycamore-tree will shade us
from the sun's heat.</p>

<p><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>All excellent good, and my stomach excellent
good too. And now I remember and find that true
which devout Lessius says: "That poor men, and those
that fast often, have much more pleasure in eating than
rich men and gluttons, that always feed before their
stomachs are empty of their last meal, and call for more;
for by that means they rob themselves of that pleasure
that hunger brings to poor men." And I do seriously
approve of that saying of yours, "that you would rather
be a civil, well-governed, well-grounded, temperate, poor
angler, than a drunken lord." But I hope there is none
such: however, I am certain of this, that I have been at
many very costly dinners that have not afforded me half
the content that this has done, for which I thank God and
you.</p>

<p>And now, good master, proceed to your promised direction
for making and ordering my artificial fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><i>Piscator</i>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>My honest scholar, I will do it; for it is a
debt due unto you by my promise....</p>

<p>... Look how it begins to rain!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and by the clouds,
if I mistake not, we shall presently have a smoking
shower, and therefore sit close: this sycamore-tree will
shelter us; and I will tell you, as they shall come into
my mind, more observations of fly-fishing for a trout....</p>

<p>... And now, scholar, my direction for fly-fishing is
ended with this shower, for it has done raining: and now
look about you, and see how pleasantly that meadow
looks; nay, and the earth smells as sweetly too. Come,
let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days
and flowers as these; and then we will thank God that
we enjoy them, and walk to the river and sit down
quietly, and try to catch the other brace of trouts.</p>

<p>Only a sweet and virtuous soul,<br />
Like season'd timber, never gives;<br />
But, though the whole world turn to coal,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 12em;">Then chiefly lives.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><i>Venator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I thank you, good master, for your good
direction for fly-fishing, and for the sweet enjoyment of
the pleasant day, which is so far spent without offence to
God or man; and I thank you for the sweet close of
your discourse with Mr. Herbert's verses, who, I have
heard, loved angling; and I do the rather believe it, because
he had a spirit suitable to anglers, and to those
primitive Christians that you love and have so much
commended.</p>

<p><i>Piscator.</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Well, my loving scholar, and I am pleased
to know that you are so well pleased with my direction
and discourse.... And now, I think it will be time to
repair to our angle-rods, which we left in the water to
fish for themselves: and you shall choose which shall be
yours; and it is an even lay, one of them catches.</p>

<p>And, let me tell you, this kind of fishing with a dead
rod, and laying night-hooks, are like putting money to
use; for they both work for the owners, when they do
nothing but sleep, or eat, or rejoice; as you know we
have done this last hour, and sat as quietly, and as free
from cares under this sycamore, as Virgil's Tityrus and
his Melib<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>us did, under their broad beech tree. No life,
my honest scholar, no life so happy and so pleasant, as
the life of a well-governed angler; for when the lawyer
is swallowed up with business, and the statesman is preventing
or contriving plots, then we sit on cowslip banks,
hear the birds sing, and possess ourselves in as much
quietness as these silent silver streams, which we now see
glide so quietly by us. Indeed, my good scholar, we
may say of angling as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries,
"Doubtless, God could have made a better berry, but
doubtless, God never did;" and so, if I might be judge,
"God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent recreation
than angling."</p>

Had doff'd her gaudy trim,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">With her great Master so to sympathize:</span><br />
It was no season then for her<br />

And on her naked shame,<br />
Pollute with sinful blame,<br />

His ready harbinger,<br />

Smoothly the waters kiss'd,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,</span><br />

<h4><span class="smcap">Lord Clarendon</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1608-1674.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">History of the Rebellion</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this unhappy battle [of Newbury] was slain the
Lord Viscount Falkland; a person of such prodigious
parts of learning and knowledge, of that inimitable
sweetness and delight in conversation, of so flowing and
obliging a humanity and goodness to mankind, and of
that primitive simplicity and integrity of life, that if there
were no other brand upon this odious and accursed civil
war, than that single loss, it must be most infamous, and
execrable to all posterity.</p>

<p>Before this parliament, his condition of life was so
happy that it was hardly capable of improvement.
Before he came to be twenty years of age, he was master
of a noble fortune, which descended to him by the gift of
a grandfather, without passing through his father or
mother, who were then both alive, and not well enough
contented to find themselves passed by in the descent.
His education for some years had been in Ireland, where
his father was lord-deputy; so that, when he returned
into England, to the possession of his fortune, he was
unentangled with any acquaintance or friends, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
usually grow up by the custom of conversation; and
therefore was to make a pure election of his company;
which he chose by other rules than were prescribed to
the young nobility of that time. And it cannot be
denied, though he admitted some few to his friendship
for the agreeableness of their natures, and their undoubted
affection to him, that his familiarity and friendship, for the
most part, was with men of the most eminent and sublime
parts, and of untouched reputation in point of integrity;
and such men had a title to his bosom.</p>

<p>He was a great cherisher of wit, and fancy, and good
parts in any man; and, if he found them clouded with
poverty or want, a most liberal and bountiful patron
towards them, even above his fortune; of which, in those
administrations, he was such a dispenser, as, if he had
been trusted with it to such uses, and if there had been
the least of vice in his expense, he might have been
thought too prodigal. He was constant and pertinacious
in whatsoever he resolved to do, and not to be wearied by
any pains that were necessary to that end. And, therefore,
having once resolved not to see London, which he
loved above all places, till he had perfectly learned the
Greek tongue, he went to his own house in the country,
and pursued it with that indefatigable industry, that it
will not be believed in how short a time he was master
of it, and accurately read all the Greek historians.</p>

<p>In this time, his house being within little more than
ten miles of Oxford, he contracted familiarity and friendship
with the most polite and accurate men of that
university; who found such an immenseness of wit, and
such a solidity of judgment in him, so infinite a fancy,
bound in by a most logical ratiocination, such a vast
knowledge, that he was not ignorant in anything, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
such an excessive humility, as if he had known nothing,
that they frequently resorted and dwelt with him, as in a
college situated in a purer air; so that his house was a
university in a less volume; whither they came not so
much for repose as study; and to examine and refine
those grosser propositions, which laziness and consent
made current in vulgar conversation....</p>

<p>He was superior to all those passions and affections
which attend vulgar minds, and was guilty of no other
ambition than of knowledge, and to be reputed a lover
of all good men; and that made him too much a contemner
of those arts, which must be indulged in the transactions
of human affairs....</p>

<p>He had a courage of the most clear and keen temper,
and so far from fear, that he seemed not without some
appetite of danger; and therefore, upon any occasion of
action, he always engaged his person in those troops
which he thought, by the forwardness of the commanders,
to be most like to be farthest engaged; and in all such
encounters, he had about him an extraordinary cheerfulness,
without at all affecting the execution that usually
attended them; in which he took no delight, but took
pains to prevent it, where it was not by resistance made
necessary: insomuch that at Edge-hill, when the enemy
was routed, he was like to have incurred great peril, by
interposing to save those who had thrown away their
arms, and against whom, it may be, others were more
fierce for their having thrown them away: so that a man
might think he came into the field chiefly out of curiosity
to see the face of danger, and charity to prevent the
shedding of blood. Yet, in his natural inclination, he
acknowledged he was addicted to the profession of a
soldier; and shortly after he came to his fortune, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he was of age, he went into the Low Countries, with a
resolution of procuring command, and to give himself up
to it; from which he was diverted by the complete inactivity
of that summer; so he returned into England, and
shortly after entered upon that vehement course of study
we mentioned before, till the first alarm from the north;
then again he made ready for the field, and though he
received some repulse in the command of a troop of
horse, of which he had a promise, he went a volunteer
with the earl of Essex.</p>

<p>From the entrance into this unnatural war, his natural
cheerfulness and vivacity grew clouded, and a kind of
sadness and dejection of spirit stole upon him, which he
had never been used to; yet being one of those who
believed that one battle would end all differences, and
that there would be so great a victory on one side, that
the other would be compelled to submit to any conditions
from the victor<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>which supposition and conclusion
generally sunk into the minds of most men, and prevented
the looking after many advantages that might
then have been laid hold of<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>he resisted those indispositions.
But after the king's return from Brentford, and
the furious resolution of the two Houses not to admit
any treaty for peace, those indispositions, which had
before touched him, grew into a perfect habit of uncheerfulness;
and he, who had been so exactly unreserved
and affable to all men, that his face and countenance was
always present, and vacant, to his company, and held
any cloudiness, and less pleasantness of the visage, a
kind of rudeness or incivility, became, on a sudden, less
communicable; and thence, very sad, pale, and exceedingly
affected with the spleen. In his clothes and habit,
which he had minded before always with more neatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and industry, and expense, than is usual to so great a
soul, he was not now only incurious, but too negligent;
and in his reception of suitors, and the necessary or
casual addresses to his place, so quick, and sharp, and
severe, that there wanted not some men<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>strangers to
his nature and disposition<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who believed him proud and
imperious; from which no mortal man was ever more
free....</p>

<p>When there was any overture or hope of peace, he
would be more erect and vigorous, and exceedingly
solicitous to press anything which he thought might
promote it; and sitting among his friends, often, after a
deep silence, and frequent sighs, would, with a shrill and
sad accent, ingeminate the word <i>Peace, Peace</i>; and
would passionately profess, "that the very agony of the
war, and the view of the calamities and desolation the
kingdom did and must endure, took his sleep from him,
and would shortly break his heart." This made some
think, or pretend to think, "that he was so much
enamoured of peace, that he would have been glad the
king should have bought it at any price;" which was a
most unreasonable calumny. As if a man, that was
himself the most punctual and precise in every circumstance
that might reflect upon conscience or honor,
could have wished the king to have committed a trespass
against either....</p>

<p>In the morning before the battle, as always upon
action, he was very cheerful, and put himself into the
first rank of the Lord Byron's regiment, then advancing
upon the enemy, who had lined the hedges on both
sides with musketeers; from whence he was shot with
a musket in the lower part of the belly, and in the
instant falling from his horse, his body was not found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
till the next morning; till when, there was some hope
he might have been a prisoner; though his nearest
friends, who knew his temper, received small comfort
from that imagination. Thus fell that incomparable
young man, in the four-and-thirtieth year of his age,
having so much despatched the true business of life,
that the oldest rarely attain to that immense knowledge,
and the youngest enter not into the world with more
innocency: whosoever leads such a life, needs be the less
anxious upon how short warning it is taken from him.</p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Tatler</span>, June 10, 1710.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> men look into their own bosoms, and consider
the generous seeds which are there planted, that might, if
rightly cultivated, ennoble their lives, and make their
virtue venerable to futurity; how can they, without
tears, reflect on the universal degeneracy from that public
spirit, which ought to be the first and principal motive
of all their actions? In the Grecian and Roman nations,
they were wise enough to keep up this great incentive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and it was impossible to be in the fashion without being
a patriot. All gallantry had its first source from hence;
and to want a warmth for the public welfare, was a
defect so scandalous, that he who was guilty of it had
no pretence to honor or manhood. What makes the
depravity among us, in this behalf, the more vexatious
and irksome to reflect upon, is, that the contempt of life
is carried as far amongst us, as it could be in those
memorable people; and we want only a proper application
of the qualities which are frequent among us, to
be as worthy as they. There is hardly a man to be
found who will not fight upon any occasion, which he
thinks may taint his own honor. Were this motive as
strong in everything that regards the public, as it is in
this our private case, no man would pass his life away
without having distinguished himself by some gallant
instance of his zeal towards it in the respective incidents
of his life and profession. But it is so far otherwise, that
there cannot at present be a more ridiculous animal,
than one who seems to regard the good of others. He,
in civil life, whose thoughts turn upon schemes which
may be of general benefit, without further reflection, is
called a projector; and the man whose mind seems
intent upon glorious achievements, a knight-errant. The
ridicule among us runs strong against laudable actions;
nay, in the ordinary course of things, and the common
regards of life, negligence of the public is an epidemic
vice. The brewer in his excise, the merchant in his
customs, and, for aught we know, the soldier in his
muster-rolls, think never the worse of themselves for
being guilty of their respective frauds towards the public.
This evil is come to such a fantastical height, that he is
a man <i>of</i> a public spirit, and heroically affected to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
country, who can go so far as even to turn usurer with
all he has in her funds. There is not a citizen in whose
imagination such a one does not appear in the same
light of glory, as Codrus, Sc<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>vola, or any other great
name in old Rome. Were it not for the heroes of so
much <i>per cent.</i> as have regard enough for themselves and
their nation to trade with her with their wealth, the very
notion of public love would long ere now have vanished
from among us. But however general custom may hurry
us away in the stream of a common error, there is no
evil, no crime, so great as that of being cold in matters
relating to the common good. This is in nothing more
conspicuous than in a certain willingness to receive
anything that tends to the diminution of such as have
been conspicuous instruments in our service. Such
inclinations proceed from the most low and vile corruption,
of which the soul of man is capable. This
effaces not only the practice, but the very approbation
of honor and virtue; and has had such an effect, that,
to speak freely, the very sense of public good has no
longer a part even in our conversations. Can then the
most generous motive of life, the good of others, be so
easily banished the breast of man? Is it possible to
draw all our passions inward? Shall the boiling heat
of youth be sunk in pleasures, the ambition of manhood
in selfish intrigues? Shall all that is glorious, all that
is worth the pursuit of great minds, be so easily rooted
out? When the universal bent of a people seems
diverted from the sense of their common good, and
common glory, it looks like a fatality, and crisis of
impending misfortune.</p>

<p>The generous nations we just now mentioned understood
this so very well, that there was hardly an oration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ever made, which did not turn upon this general sense,
"That the love of their country was the first and most
essential quality in an honest mind." Demosthenes,
in a cause wherein his fame, reputation, and fortune,
were embarked, puts his all upon this issue; "Let the
Athenians," says he, "be benevolent to me, as they think
I have been zealous for them." This great and discerning
orator knew, there was nothing else in nature could
bear him up against his adversaries, but this one quality
of having shown himself willing or able to serve his
country. This certainly is the test of merit; and the first
foundation for deserving good-will is, having it yourself.
The adversary of this orator at that time was <ins class="translit" title="AE ligature">&#198;</ins>schines,
a man of wily arts and skill in the world, who could, as
occasion served, fall in with a national start of passion,
or sullenness of humor, which a whole nation is sometimes
taken with as well as a private man; and by that
means divert them from their common sense, into an
aversion for receiving anything in its true light. But
when Demosthenes had awakened his audience with that
one hint of judging by the general tenor of his life
towards them, his services bore down his opponent before
him, who fled to the covert of his mean arts, until some
more favorable opportunity should offer against the
superior merit of Demosthenes.</p>

<p>It were to be wished, that love of their country were
the first principle of action in men of business, even for
their own sakes; for when the world begins to examine
into their conduct, the generality, who have no share in,
or hopes of any part in power or riches, but what is the
effect of their own labor or prosperity, will judge of them
by no other method, than that of how profitable their
administration has been to the whole. They who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
out of the influence of men's fortune or favor, will let
them stand or fall by this one only rule; and men who
can bear being tried by it, are always popular in their
fall. Those, who cannot suffer such a scrutiny, are contemptible
in their advancement.</p>

<p>But I am here running into shreds of maxims from
reading Tacitus this morning, which has driven me from
my recommendation of public spirit, which was the
intended purpose of this lucubration. There is not a
more glorious instance of it, than in the character of
Regulus. This same Regulus was taken prisoner by the
Carthaginians, and was sent by them to Rome, in order
to demand some Punic noblemen, who were prisoners,
in exchange for himself; and was bound by an oath
that he would return to Carthage, if he failed in his
commission. He proposes this to the senate, who were
in suspense upon it, which Regulus observing, without
having the least notion of putting the care of his own
life in competition with the public good, desired them
to consider that he was old, and almost useless; that
those demanded in exchange were men of daring
tempers, and great merit in military affairs; and
wondered they would make any doubt of permitting
him to go back to the short tortures prepared for him
at Carthage, where he should have the advantage of
ending a long life both gloriously and usefully. This
generous advice was consented to; and he took his
leave of his country and his weeping friends, to go to
certain death, with that cheerful composure, as a man,
after the fatigue of business in a court or a city, retires
to the next village for the air.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> lately entertaining myself with comparing
Homer's balance, in which Jupiter is represented as
weighing the fates of Hector and Achilles, with a passage
of Virgil, wherein that deity is introduced as
weighing the fates of Turnus and <ins class="translit" title="AE ligature">&#198;</ins>neas. I then
considered how the same way of thinking prevailed in
the eastern parts of the world, as in those noble passages
of Scripture, where we are told, that the great king of
Babylon, the day before his death, had been weighed
in the balance, and been found wanting. In other
places of the holy writings the Almighty is described
as weighing the mountains in scales, making the weight
for the winds, knowing the balancings of the clouds;
and, in others, as weighing the actions of men, and
laying their calamities together in a balance. Milton, as
I have observed in a former paper, had an eye to several
of these foregoing instances, in that beautiful description
wherein he represents the archangel and the evil spirit
as addressing themselves for the combat, but parted by
the balance which appeared in the heavens, and weighed
the consequences of such a battle.</p>

</div>

<p>These several amusing thoughts having taken possession
of my mind some time before I went to sleep, and
mingling themselves with my ordinary ideas, raised in
my imagination a very odd kind of vision. I was,
methought, replaced in my study, and seated in my
elbow-chair, where I had indulged the foregoing speculations,
with my lamp burning by me, as usual. Whilst
I was here meditating on several subjects of morality,
and considering the nature of many virtues and vices, as
materials for those discourses with which I daily entertain
the public; I saw, methought, a pair of golden scales
hanging by a chain in the same metal over the table
that stood before me; when, on a sudden, there were
great heaps of weights thrown down on each side of
them. I found upon examining these weights, they
showed the value of everything that is in esteem among
men. I made an essay of them, by putting the weight
of wisdom in one scale, and that of riches in another,
upon which the latter, to show its comparative lightness,
immediately "flew up and kicked the beam."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>But, before I proceed, I must inform my reader, that
these weights did not exert their natural gravity, till they
were laid in the golden balance, insomuch that I could
not guess which was light or heavy, whilst I held them
in my hand. This I found by several instances, for
upon my laying a weight in one of the scales, which was
inscribed by the word Eternity; though I threw in that
of time, prosperity, affliction, wealth, poverty, interest,
success, with many other weights, which in my hand
seemed very ponderous, they were not able to stir the
opposite balance, nor could they have prevailed, though
assisted with the weight of the sun, the stars, and the
earth.</p>

<p>Upon emptying the scales, I laid several titles and
honors, with pomps, triumphs, and many weights of the
like nature, in one of them, and seeing a little glittering
weight lie by me, I threw it accidentally into the other
scale, when, to my great surprise, it proved so exact a
counterpoise, that it kept the balance in an equilibrium.
This little glittering weight was inscribed upon the edges
of it with the word Vanity. I found there were several
other weights which were equally heavy, and exact
counterpoises to one another; a few of them I tried, as
avarice and poverty, riches and content, with some
others.</p>

<p>There were likewise several weights that were of the
same figure, and seemed to correspond with each other,
but were entirely different when thrown into the scales,
as religion and hypocrisy, pedantry and learning, wit and
vivacity, superstition and devotion, gravity and wisdom,
with many others.</p>

<p>I observed one particular weight lettered on both sides,
and upon applying myself to the reading of it, I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on one side written "<i>In the dialect of men</i>," and underneath
it, "<span class="smcap">calamities</span>;" on the other side was written,
"<i>In the language of the gods</i>," and underneath, "<span class="smcap">blessings</span>."
I found the intrinsic value of this weight to be
much greater than I imagined, for it overpowered health,
wealth, good-fortune, and many other weights, which
were much more ponderous in my hand than the other.</p>

<p>There is a saying among the Scotch, that "an ounce
of mother is worth a pound of clergy;" I was sensible
of the truth of this saying, when I saw the difference
between the weight of natural parts and that of learning.
The observation which I made upon these two weights
opened to me a new field of discoveries, for notwithstanding
the weight of natural parts was much heavier
than that of learning, I observed that it weighed an
hundred times heavier than it did before, when I put
learning into the same scale with it. I made the same
observation upon faith and morality; for notwithstanding
the latter outweighed the former separately, it received a
thousand times more additional weight from its conjunction
with the former, than what it had by itself. This
odd phenomenon showed itself in other particulars, as in
wit and judgment, philosophy and religion, justice and
humanity, zeal and charity, depth of sense and perspicuity
of style, with innumerable other particulars, too
long to be mentioned in this paper.</p>

<p>As a dream seldom fails of dashing seriousness with
impertinence, mirth with gravity, methought I made
several other experiments of a more ludicrous nature, by
one of which I found that an English octavo was very
often heavier than a French folio; and by another, that
an old Greek or Latin author weighed down a whole
library of moderns. Seeing one of my <i>Spectators</i> lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by me, I laid it into one of the scales, and flung a
twopenny piece in the other. The reader will not inquire
into the event, if he remembers the first trial which I
have recorded in this paper. I afterwards threw both
the sexes into the balance; but as it is not for my
interest to disoblige either of them, I shall desire to be
excused from telling the result of this experiment.
Having an opportunity of this nature in my hands, I
could not forbear throwing into one scale the principles
of a Tory, and in the other those of a Whig; but as I
have all along declared this to be a neutral paper, I shall
likewise desire to be silent under this head also, though
upon examining one of the weights, I saw the word
TEKEL engraven on it in capital letters.</p>

<p>I made many other experiments, and though I have
not room for them all in this day's speculation, I may
perhaps reserve them for another. I shall only add,
that upon my awaking I was sorry to find my golden
scales vanished, but resolved for the future to learn this
lesson from them, not to despise or value any things for
their appearances, but to regulate my esteem and passions
towards them according to their real and intrinsic value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> inferior duties of life which the French call
<i>les petites morales</i>, or the smaller morals, are with us
distinguished by the name of good manners or breeding.
This I look upon, in the general notion of it, to be a
sort of artificial good sense, adapted to the meanest
capacities, and introduced to make mankind easy in
their commerce with each other. Low and little understandings,
without some rules of this kind, would be
perpetually wandering into a thousand indecencies and
irregularities in behavior; and in their ordinary conversation,
fall into the same boisterous familiarities that
one observeth amongst them when a debauch hath quite
taken away the use of their reason. In other instances,
it is odd to consider, that for want of common discretion,
the very end of good breeding is wholly perverted; and
civility, intended to make us easy, is employed in laying
chains and fetters upon us, in debarring us of our wishes,
and in crossing our most reasonable desires and inclinations.
This abuse reigneth chiefly in the country, as I
found to my vexation, when I was last there, in a visit I
made to a neighbor about two miles from my cousin.
As soon as I entered the parlor, they put me into the
great chair that stood close by a huge fire, and kept me
there by force, until I was almost stifled. Then a boy
came in great hurry to pull off my boots, which I in
vain opposed, urging that I must return soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
dinner. In the meantime, the good lady whispered her
eldest daughter, and slipped a key into her hand. The
girl returned instantly with a beer-glass half full of <i>aqua
mirabilis</i> and syrup of gillyflowers. I took as much as
I had a mind for; but madam avowed I should drink it
off<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for she was sure it would do me good, after coming
out of the cold air<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and I was forced to obey; which
absolutely took away my stomach. When dinner came
in, I had a mind to sit at a distance from the fire; but
they told me it was as much as my life was worth, and
set me with my back just against it. Although my
appetite was quite gone, I resolved to force down as
much as I could; and desired the leg of a pullet. "Indeed,
Mr. Bickerstaff," says the lady, "you must eat a
wing, to oblige me;" and so put a couple upon my plate.
I was persecuted at this rate during the whole meal. As
often as I called for small-beer, the master tipped the
wink, and the servant brought me a brimmer of October.
Some time after dinner, I ordered my cousin's man, who
came with me, to get ready the horses; but it was resolved
I should not stir that night; and when I seemed pretty
much bent upon going, they ordered the stable door to
be locked; and the children hid my cloak and boots.
The next question was, what I would have for supper.
I said I never ate anything at night; but was at last, in
my own defence, obliged to name the first thing that
came into my head. After three hours spent chiefly in
apologies for my entertainment, insinuating to me, "that
this was the worst time of the year for provisions; that
they were at a great distance from any market; that
they were afraid I should be starved; and that they
knew they kept me to my loss," the lady went, and left
me to her husband<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for they took special care I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
never be alone. As soon as her back was turned, the
little misses ran backward and forward every moment;
and constantly as they came in, or went out, made a
courtesy directly at me, which, in good manners, I was
forced to return with a bow, and, "Your humble servant,
pretty miss." Exactly at eight the mother came up,
and discovered by the redness of her face that supper
was not far off. It was twice as large as the dinner, and
my persecution doubled in proportion. I desired, at my
usual hour, to go to my repose, and was conducted to my
chamber by the gentleman, his lady, and the whole train
of children. They importuned me to drink something
before I went to bed; and upon my refusing, at last left
a bottle of <i>stingo</i>, as they called it, for fear I should wake
and be thirsty in the night. I was forced in the morning
to rise and dress myself in the dark, because they would
not suffer my kinsman's servant to disturb me at the
hour I desired to be called. I was now resolved to
break through all measures to get away; and after
sitting down to a monstrous breakfast of cold beef,
mutton, neats' tongues, venison-pasty, and stale-beer,
took leave of the family. But the gentleman would
needs see me part of my way, and carry me a short-cut
through his own grounds, which he told me would save
half a mile's riding. This last piece of civility had like
to have cost me dear, being once or twice in danger
of my neck, by leaping over his ditches, and at last
forced to alight in the dirt; when my horse, having
slipped his bridle, ran away, and took us up more than
an hour to recover him again. It is evident that none of
the absurdities I met with in this visit proceeded from
an ill intention, but from a wrong judgment of complaisance,
and a misapplication in the rules of it.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Mahomet had, by means of his pretended
revelations, united the dispersed Arabians under one
head, they issued forth from their deserts in great
multitudes; and being animated with zeal for their new
religion, and supported by the vigor of their new government,
they made deep impression on the eastern empire,
which was far in the decline, with regard both to military
discipline and to civil policy. Jerusalem, by its situation,
became one of their most early conquests; and the
Christians had the mortification to see the holy sepulchre,
and the other places, consecrated by the presence
of their religious founder, fallen into the possession
of infidels. But the Arabians or Saracens were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
employed in military enterprises, by which they spread
their empire in a few years from the banks of the
Ganges to the Straits of Gibraltar, that they had no
leisure for theological controversy: and though the
Alcoran, the original monument of their faith, seems
to contain some violent precepts, they were much less
infected with the spirit of bigotry and persecution
than the indolent and speculative Greeks, who were
continually refining on the several articles of their religious
system. They gave little disturbance to those
zealous pilgrims, who daily flocked to Jerusalem; and
they allowed every man, after paying a moderate tribute,
to visit the holy sepulchre, to perform his religious
duties, and to return in peace. But the Turcomans or
Turks, a tribe of Tartars, who had embraced Mahometanism,
having wrested Syria from the Saracens, and
having, in the year 1065, made themselves masters of
Jerusalem, rendered the pilgrimage much more difficult
and dangerous to the Christians. The barbarity of their
manners, and the confusions attending their unsettled
government, exposed the pilgrims to many insults,
robberies, and extortions: and these zealots, returning
from their meritorious fatigues and sufferings, filled all
Christendom with indignation against the infidels, who
profaned the holy city by their presence, and derided
the sacred mysteries in the very place of their completion.
Gregory VII., among the other vast ideas
which he entertained, had formed the design of uniting
all the Western Christians against the Mahometans;
but the egregious and violent invasions of that pontiff
on the civil power of princes, had created him so many
enemies, and had rendered his schemes so suspicious,
that he was not able to make great progress in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
undertaking. The work was reserved for a meaner
instrument, whose low condition in life exposed him to
no jealousy, and whose folly was well calculated to
coincide with the prevailing principles of the times.</p>

<p>Peter, commonly called the Hermit, a native of
Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
Being deeply affected with the dangers to which
that act of piety now exposed the pilgrims, as well as
with the instances of oppression under which the Eastern
Christians labored, he entertained the bold, and, in all
appearance, impracticable project of leading into Asia,
from the farthest extremities of the West, armies sufficient
to subdue those potent and warlike nations which
now held the holy city in subjection. He proposed his
views to Martin II., who filled the papal chair, and who,
though sensible of the advantages which the head of the
Christian religion must reap from a religious war, and
though he esteemed the blind zeal of Peter a proper
means for effecting the purpose, resolved not to interpose
his authority, till he saw a greater probability of success.
He summoned a council at Placentia, which consisted of
four thousand ecclesiastics, and thirty thousand seculars;
and which was so numerous that no hall could contain
the multitude, and it was necessary to hold the assembly
in a plain. The harangues of the Pope, and of Peter himself,
representing the dismal situation of their brethren
in the East, and the indignity suffered by the Christian
name, in allowing the holy city to remain in the hands
of infidels, here found the minds of men so well prepared,
that the whole multitude suddenly and violently declared
for the war, and solemnly devoted themselves to perform
this service, so meritorious, as they believed it, to God
and religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But though Italy seemed thus to have zealously embraced
the enterprise, Martin knew, that, in order to
insure success, it was necessary to enlist the greater and
more warlike nations in the same engagement; and
having previously exhorted Peter to visit the chief cities
and sovereigns of Christendom, he summoned another
council at Clermont in Auvergne. The fame of this
great and pious design being now universally diffused,
procured the attendance of the greatest prelates, nobles,
and princes; and when the Pope and the Hermit renewed
their pathetic exhortations, the whole assembly, as if
impelled by an immediate inspiration, not moved by
their preceding impressions, exclaimed with one voice, <i>It
is the will of God, It is the will of God!</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>words deemed
so memorable, and so much the result of a divine influence,
that they were employed as the signal of rendezvous
and battle in all the future exploits of those adventurers.
Men of all ranks flew to arms with the utmost ardor;
and an exterior symbol, too, a circumstance of chief
moment, was here chosen by the devoted combatants.
The sign of the cross, which had been hitherto so much
revered among Christians, and which, the more it was an
object of reproach among the Pagan world, was the more
passionately cherished by them, became the badge of
union, and was affixed to their right shoulder, by all who
enlisted themselves in this sacred warfare.</p>

<p>Europe was at this time sunk into profound ignorance
and superstition. The ecclesiastics had acquired the
greatest ascendant over the human mind: the people,
who, being little restrained by honor, and less by law,
abandoned themselves to the worst crimes and disorders,
knew of no other expiation than the observances imposed
on them by their spiritual pastors: and it was easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
represent the holy war as an equivalent for all penances,
and an atonement for every violation of justice and
humanity. But amidst the abject superstition which
now prevailed, the military spirit also had universally
diffused itself; and though not supported by art or
discipline, was become the general passion of the nations
governed by the feudal law. All the great lords possessed
the right of peace and war: they were engaged
in perpetual hostilities with each other: the open country
was become a scene of outrage and disorder: the cities,
still mean and poor, were neither guarded by walls nor
protected by privileges, and were exposed to every
insult: individuals were obliged to depend for safety on
their own force, or their private alliances: and valor was
the only excellence which was held in esteem, or gave
one man the pre-eminence above another. When all the
particular superstitions, therefore, were here united in
one great object, the ardor for military enterprises took
the same direction; and Europe, impelled by its two
ruling passions, was loosened, as it were, from its foundations,
and seemed to precipitate itself in one united
body upon the East.</p>

<p>All orders of men, deeming the Crusades the only
road to heaven, enlisted themselves under these sacred
banners, and were impatient to open the way with their
sword to the holy city. Nobles, artisans, peasants, even
priests, enrolled their names; and to decline this meritorious
service was branded with the reproach of impiety,
or, what perhaps was esteemed still more disgraceful, of
cowardice and pusillanimity. The infirm and aged contributed
to the expedition by presents and money; and
many of them, not satisfied with the merit of this atonement,
attended it in person, and were determined, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
possible, to breathe their last in sight of that city where
their Saviour had died for them. Women themselves,
concealing their sex under the disguise of armor, attended
the camp. The greatest criminals were forward in a
service, which they regarded as a propitiation for all
crimes; and the most enormous disorders were, during
the course of those expeditions, committed by men
enured to wickedness, encouraged by example, and
impelled by necessity. The multitude of the adventurers
soon became so great, that their more sagacious leaders,
Hugh count of Vermandois, brother to the French
king, Raymond count of Toulouse, Godfrey of Bouillon,
prince of Brabant, and Stephen count of Blois, became
apprehensive lest the greatness itself of the armament
should disappoint its purpose; and they permitted an
undisciplined multitude, computed at 300,000 men, to go
before them, under the command of Peter the Hermit
and Walter the Moneyless. These men took the road
towards Constantinople through Hungary and Bulgaria;
and trusting that Heaven, by supernatural assistance,
would supply all their necessities, they made no provision
for subsistance on their march. They soon found themselves
obliged to obtain by plunder, what they had
vainly expected from miracles; and the enraged inhabitants
of the countries through which they passed,
gathering together in arms, attacked the disorderly
multitude and put them to slaughter without resistance.
The more disciplined armies followed after; and passing
the straights at Constantinople, they were mustered in
the plains of Asia, and amounted in the whole to the
number of 700,000 combatants....</p>

<p>After the adventurers in the holy war were assembled
on the banks of the Bosphorus, opposite to Constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>inople,
they proceeded on their enterprise; but immediately
experienced those difficulties which their zeal had
hitherto concealed from them, and for which, even if
they had foreseen them, it would have been almost
impossible to provide a remedy. The Greek emperor,
Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to the Western
Christians for succor against the Turks, entertained
hopes, and those but feeble ones, of obtaining such a
moderate supply, as, acting under his command, might
enable him to repulse the enemy: but he was extremely
astonished to see his dominions overwhelmed, on a
sudden, by such an inundation of licentious barbarians,
who, though they pretended friendship, despised his
subjects as unwarlike, and detested them as heretical.
By all the arts of policy, in which he excelled, he
endeavored to divert the torrent; but while he employed
professions, caresses, civilities, and seeming services
towards the leaders of the crusade, he secretly regarded
those imperious allies as more dangerous than the open
enemies by whom his empire had been formerly invaded.
Having effected that difficult point of disembarking
them safely in Asia, he entered into a private correspondence
with Soliman, emperor of the Turks; and
practised every insidious art, which his genius, his power,
or his situation, enabled him to employ, for disappointing
the enterprise, and discouraging the Latins from making
thenceforward any such prodigious migrations. His
dangerous policy was seconded by the disorders inseparable
from so vast a multitude, who were not united under
one head, and were conducted by leaders of the most
independent intractable spirit, unacquainted with military
discipline, and determined enemies to civil authority and
submission. The scarcity of provisions, the excesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fatigue, the influence of unknown climates, joined to the
want of concert in their operations, and to the sword of
a warlike enemy, destroyed the adventurers by thousands,
and would have abated the ardor of men impelled to war
by less powerful motives. Their zeal, however, their
bravery, and their irresistible force, still carried them
forward, and continually advanced them to the great end
of their enterprise. After an obstinate siege they took
Nice, the seat of the Turkish empire; they defeated
Soliman in two great battles; they made themselves
masters of Antioch; and entirely broke the force of the
Turks, who had so long retained those countries in
subjection. The soldan of Egypt, whose alliance they
had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall of the Turkish
power, his former authority in Jerusalem; and he informed
them by his ambassadors, that if they came
disarmed to that city, they might now perform their
religious vows, and that all Christian pilgrims, who
should thenceforth visit the holy sepulchre, might expect
the same good treatment which they had ever received
from his predecessors. The offer was rejected; the
soldan was required to yield up the city to the Christians;
and on his refusal, the champions of the cross advanced
to the siege of Jerusalem, which they regarded as the
consummation of their labors. By the detachments
which they had made, and the disasters which they had
undergone, they were diminished to the number of
twenty thousand foot, and fifteen hundred horse; but
these were still formidable, from their valor, their experience,
and the obedience which, from past calamities,
they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a siege of
five weeks, they took Jerusalem by assault; and, impelled
by a mixture of military and religious rage, they put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
numerous garrison and inhabitants to the sword without
distinction.</p>

<p>Neither arms defended the valiant, nor submission
the timorous: no age or sex was spared: infants on
the breast were pierced by the same blow with their
mothers, who implored for mercy: even a multitude to
the number of ten thousand persons, who had surrendered
themselves prisoners, and were promised quarter, were
butchered in cold blood by those ferocious conquerors.
The streets of Jerusalem were covered with dead bodies;
and the triumphant warriors, after every enemy was
subdued and slaughtered, immediately turned themselves,
with the sentiments of humiliation and contrition, towards
the holy sepulchre. They threw aside their arms,
still streaming with blood: they advanced with reclined
bodies, and naked feet and heads, to that sacred monument:
they sang anthems to their Saviour, who had
there purchased their salvation by his death and agony:
and their devotion, enlivened by the presence of the
place where he had suffered, so overcame their fury,
that they dissolved in tears, and bore the appearance of
every soft and tender sentiment. So inconsistent is
human nature with itself! and so easily does the most
effeminate superstition ally, both with the most heroic
courage and with the fiercest barbarity!</p>

<p>This great event happened on the fifth of July in the
last year of the eleventh century. The Christian princes
and nobles, after choosing Godfrey of Bouillon king of
Jerusalem, began to settle themselves in their new conquests;
while some of them returned to Europe, in order
to enjoy at home that glory, which their valor had
acquired them in this popular and meritorious enterprise.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4>HOUSE OF LORDS<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>November 18th, 1777.</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lord Chatham</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1708-1778.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">I rise</span>, my Lords, to declare my sentiments on this
most solemn and serious subject. It has imposed a load
upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can remove, but
which impels me to endeavor its alleviation, by a free
and unreserved communication of my sentiments.</p>

<p>In the first part of the address, I have the honor of
heartily concurring with the noble Earl who moved it.
No man feels sincerer joy than I do; none can offer more
genuine congratulations on every accession of strength
to the Protestant succession. I therefore join in every
congratulation on the birth of another princess, and the
happy recovery of her Majesty.</p>

<p>But I must stop here. My courtly complaisance will
carry me no farther. I will not join in congratulation
on misfortune and disgrace. I cannot concur in a blind
and servile address, which approves and endeavors to
sanctify the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace
and misfortune upon us. This, my Lords, is a
perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time for
adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot now
avail<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>cannot save us in this rugged and awful crisis. It
is now necessary to instruct the Throne in the language
of truth. We must dispel the illusion and the darkness
which envelop it, and display, in its full danger and true
colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.</p>

<p>This, my Lords, is our duty. It is the proper function
of this noble assembly, sitting, as we do, upon our honors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
in this House, the hereditary council of the Crown.
<i>Who</i> is the minister<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>where</i> is the minister, that has
dared to suggest to the Throne the contrary, unconstitutional
language this day delivered from it? The
accustomed language from the Throne has been application
to Parliament for advice, and a reliance on its
constitutional advice and assistance. As it is the right
of Parliament to give, so it is the duty of the Crown to
ask it. But on this day, and in this extreme momentous
exigency, no reliance is reposed on our constitutional
counsels! no advice is asked from the sober and enlightened
care of Parliament! but the Crown, from itself and
by itself, declares an unalterable determination to pursue
measures<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and what measures, my Lords? The measures
that have produced the imminent perils that
threaten us; the measures that have brought ruin to our
doors.</p>

<p>Can the minister of the day now presume to expect a
continuance of support in this ruinous infatuation? Can
Parliament be so dead to its dignity and its duty as to
be thus deluded into the loss of the one and the violation
of the other? To give an unlimited credit and support
for the steady perseverance in measures not proposed for
our parliamentary advice, but dictated and forced upon
us<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in measures, I say, my Lords, which have reduced
this late flourishing empire to ruin and contempt! "But
yesterday, and England might have stood against the
world: now none so poor to do her reverence." I use
the words of a poet; but, though it be poetry, it is no
fiction. It is a shameful truth, that not only the power
and strength of this country are wasting away and expiring,
but her well-earned glories, her true honor, and
substantial dignity are sacrificed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>France, my Lords, has insulted you; she has encouraged
and sustained America; and, whether America be
wrong or right, the dignity of this country ought to
spurn at the officious insult of French interference. The
ministers and ambassadors of those who are called rebels
and enemies are in Paris; in Paris they transact the
reciprocal interests of America and France. Can there
be a more mortifying insult? Can even our ministers
sustain a more humiliating disgrace? Do they dare to
resent it? Do they presume even to hint a vindication
of their honor, and the dignity of the State, by requiring
the dismission of the plenipotentiaries of America?
Such is the degradation to which they have reduced the
glories of England! The people whom they affect to
call contemptible rebels, but whose growing power has
at last obtained the name of enemies; the people with
whom they have engaged this country in war, and
against whom they now command our implicit support
in every measure of desperate hostility<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>this people,
despised as rebels, or acknowledged as enemies, are
abetted against you, supplied with every military store,
their interests consulted, and their ambassadors entertained,
by your inveterate enemy! and our ministers dare
not interpose with dignity or effect. Is this the honor
of a great kingdom? Is this the indignant spirit of
England, who "but yesterday" gave law to the house of
Bourbon? My Lords, the dignity of nations demands
a decisive conduct in a situation like this....</p>

<p>My Lords, this ruinous and ignominious situation,
where we can not act with success, nor suffer with honor,
calls upon us to remonstrate in the strongest and loudest
language of truth, to rescue the ear of majesty from the
delusions which surround it. The desperate state of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks more
highly of them than I do. I love and honor the English
troops. I know their virtues and their valor. I know
they can achieve anything except impossibilities; and I
know that the conquest of English America <i>is an impossibility</i>.
You cannot, I venture to say it, <i>you cannot</i>
conquer America. Your armies in the last war effected
everything that could be effected; and what was it? It
cost a numerous army, under the command of a most
able general [Lord Amherst], now a noble Lord in this
House, a long and laborious campaign, to expel five
thousand Frenchmen from French America. My Lords,
<i>you cannot conquer America</i>. What is your present
situation there? We do not know the worst; but we
know that in three campaigns we have done nothing and
suffered much. Besides the sufferings, perhaps <i>total loss</i>
of the Northern force, the best appointed army that ever
took the field, commanded by Sir William Howe, has
retired from the American lines. <i>He was obliged</i> to
relinquish his attempt, and with great delay and danger
to adopt a new and distant plan of operations. We
shall soon know, and in any event have reason to lament,
what may have happened since. As to conquest, therefore,
my Lords, I repeat, it is impossible. You may
swell every expense and every effort still more extravagantly;
pile and accumulate every assistance you can
buy or borrow; traffic and barter with every little pitiful
German prince that sells and sends his subjects to the
shambles of a foreign prince; your efforts are forever
vain and impotent<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>doubly so from this mercenary aid
on which you rely; for it irritates, to an incurable
resentment, the minds of your enemies, to overrun them
with the mercenary sons of rapine and plunder, devoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
them and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling
cruelty! If I were an American, as I am an Englishman,
while a foreign troop was landed in my country, I
never would lay down my arms<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>never<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>never<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>never.</p>

<p>But, my Lords, who is the man, that, in addition to
these disgraces and mischiefs of our army, has dared to
authorize and associate to our arms the tomahawk and
scalping-knife of the savage? to call into civilized alliance
the wild and inhuman savage of the woods; to delegate
to the merciless Indian the defence of disputed rights,
and to wage the horrors of his barbarous war against our
brethren? My Lords, these enormities cry aloud for
redress and punishment. Unless thoroughly done away,
it will be a stain on the national character. It is a violation
of the Constitution. I believe it is against law.
It is not the least of our national misfortunes that the
strength and character of our army are thus impaired.
Infected with the mercenary spirit of robbery and rapine,
familiarized to the horrid scenes of savage cruelty, it can
no longer boast of the noble and generous principles
which dignify a soldier, no longer sympathize with the
dignity of the royal banner, nor feel the pride, pomp, and
circumstance of glorious war, "that make ambition
virtue!" What makes ambition virtue?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the sense of
honor. But is the sense of honor consistent with a spirit
of plunder, or the practice of murder? Can it flow from
mercenary motives, or can it prompt to cruel deeds?</p>

<p>The independent views of America have been stated
and asserted as the foundation of this address. My
Lords, no man wishes for the due dependence of America
on this country more than I do. To preserve it, and not
confirm that state of independence into which your
measures hitherto have driven them, is the object which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
we ought to unite in attaining. The Americans, contending
for their rights against arbitrary exactions, I
love and admire. It is the struggle of free and virtuous
patriots. But, contending for independency and total
disconnection from England, as an Englishman, I cannot
wish them success; for in a due constitutional dependency,
including the ancient supremacy of this country
in regulating their commerce and navigation, consists
the mutual happiness and prosperity both of England
and America. She derived assistance and protection
from us; and we reaped from her the most important
advantages. She was, indeed, the fountain of our wealth,
the nerve of our strength, the nursery and basis of our
naval power. It is our duty, therefore, my Lords, if we
wish to save our country, most seriously to endeavor the
recovery of these most beneficial subjects; and in this
perilous crisis, perhaps the present moment may be the
only one in which we can hope for success. For in their
negotiations with France, they have, or think they have,
reason to complain; though it be notorious that they have
received from that power important supplies and assistance
of various kinds, yet it is certain they expected it
in a more decisive and immediate degree. America is in
ill humor with France; on some points they have not
entirely answered her expectations. Let us wisely take
advantage of every possible moment of reconciliation.
Besides, the natural disposition of America herself still
leans toward England; to the old habits of connection
and mutual interest that united both countries. This
<i>was</i> the established sentiment of all the continent; and
still, my Lords, in the great and principal part, the sound
part of America, this wise and affectionate disposition
prevails. And there is a very considerable part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
America yet sound<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the middle and the southern provinces.
Some parts may be factious and blind to their
true interests; but if we express a wise and benevolent
disposition to communicate with them those immutable
rights of nature and those constitutional liberties to
which they are equally entitled with ourselves, by a
conduct so just and humane we shall confirm the favorable
and conciliate the adverse. I say, my Lords, the
rights and liberties to which they are equally entitled
with ourselves, <i>but no more</i>. I would participate to them
every enjoyment and freedom which the colonizing
subjects of a free state can possess, or wish to possess;
and I do not see why they should not enjoy every fundamental
right in their property, and every original
substantial liberty, which Devonshire, or Surrey, or the
county I live in, or any other county in England, can
claim; reserving always, as the sacred right of the
mother country, the due constitutional dependency of
the colonies. The inherent supremacy of the state in
regulating and protecting the navigation and commerce
of all her subjects, is necessary for the mutual benefit
and preservation of every part, to constitute and preserve
the prosperous arrangement of the whole empire.</p>

<p>The sound parts of America, of which I have spoken,
must be sensible of these great truths and of their real
interests. America is not in that state of desperate and
contemptible rebellion which this country has been
deluded to believe. It is not a wild and lawless banditti,
who, having nothing to lose, might hope to snatch something
from public convulsions. Many of their leaders
and great men have a great stake in this great contest.
The gentleman who conducts their armies, I am told, has
an estate of four or five thousand pounds a year; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
when I consider these things, I cannot but lament the
inconsiderate violence of our penal acts, our declaration
of treason and rebellion, with all the fatal effects of
attainder and confiscation.</p>

<p>As to the disposition of foreign powers which is asserted
[in the King's speech] to be pacific and friendly,
let us judge, my Lords, rather by their actions and the
nature of things than by interested assertions. The
uniform assistance supplied to America by France suggests
a different conclusion. The most important interests
of France in aggrandizing and enriching herself
with what she most wants, supplies of every naval store
from America, must inspire her with different sentiments.
The extraordinary preparations of the House of Bourbon,
by land and by sea, from Dunkirk to the Straits, equally
ready and willing to overwhelm these defenceless islands,
should rouse us to a sense of their real disposition and
our own danger. Not five thousand troops in England!
hardly three thousand in Ireland! What can we oppose
to the combined force of our enemies? Scarcely twenty
ships of the line so fully or sufficiently manned, that
any admiral's reputation would permit him to take the
command of. The river of Lisbon in the possession of
our enemies! The seas swept by American privateers!
Our Channel trade torn to pieces by them! In this
complicated crisis of danger, weakness at home, and
calamity abroad, terrified and insulted by the neighboring
powers, unable to act in America, or acting only to
be destroyed, where is the man with the forehead to
promise or hope for success in such a situation, or from
perseverance in the measures that have driven us to it?
Who has the forehead to do so? Where is that man?
I should be glad to see his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>You cannot <i>conciliate</i> America by your present measures.
You cannot <i>subdue</i> her by your present or by
any measures. What, then, can you do? You cannot
conquer; you cannot gain; but you can <i>address</i>; you
can lull the fears and anxieties of the moment into an
ignorance of the danger that should produce them.
But, my Lords, the time demands the language of truth.
We must not now apply the flattering unction of servile
compliance or blind complaisance. In a just and necessary
war, to maintain the rights or honor of my country,
I would strip the shirt from my back to support it. But
in such a war as this, unjust in its principle, impracticable
in its means, and ruinous in its consequences, I would
not contribute a single effort nor a single shilling. I do
not call for vengeance on the heads of those who have
been guilty; I only recommend to them to make their
retreat. Let them walk off; and let them make haste,
or they may be assured that speedy and condign punishment
will overtake them.</p>

<p>My Lords, I have submitted to you, with the freedom
and truth which I think my duty, my sentiments on your
present awful situation. I have laid before you the ruin
of your power, the disgrace of your reputation, the
pollution of your discipline, the contamination of your
morals, the complication of calamities, foreign and
domestic, that overwhelm your sinking country. Your
dearest interests, your own liberties, the Constitution
itself totters to the foundation. All this disgraceful
danger, this multitude of misery, is the monstrous offspring
of this unnatural war. We have been deceived
and deluded too long. Let us now stop short. This is
the crisis<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the only crisis of time and situation, to give
us a possibility of escape from the fatal effects of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
delusions. But if, in an obstinate and infatuated perseverance
in folly, we slavishly echo the peremptory words
this day presented to us, nothing can save this devoted
country from complete and final ruin. We madly rush
into multiplied miseries, and "confusion worse confounded."</p>

<p>Is it possible, can it be believed, that ministers are yet
blind to this impending destruction? I did hope, that
instead of this false and empty vanity, this overweening
pride, engendering high conceits and presumptuous imaginations,
ministers would have humbled themselves in
their errors, would have confessed and retracted them,
and by an active, though a late, repentance, have endeavored
to redeem them. But, my Lords, since they
had neither sagacity to foresee, nor justice nor humanity
to shun these oppressive calamities<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>since not even severe
experience can make them feel, nor the imminent
ruin of their country awaken them from their stupefaction,
the guardian care of Parliament must interpose. I
shall, therefore, my Lords, propose to you an amendment
of the address to his Majesty, to be inserted immediately
after the two first paragraphs of congratulation on the
birth of a princess, to recommend an immediate cessation
of hostilities, and the commencement of a treaty to
restore peace and liberty to America, strength and
happiness to England, security and permanent prosperity
to both countries. This, my Lords, is yet in our power;
and let not the wisdom and justice of your Lordships
neglect the happy, and, perhaps, the only opportunity.
By the establishment of irrevocable law, founded on
mutual rights, and ascertained by treaty, these glorious
enjoyments may be firmly perpetuated. And let me
repeat to your Lordships, that the strong bias of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
America, at least of the wise and sounder parts of it,
naturally inclines to this happy and constitutional reconnection
with you. Notwithstanding the temporary intrigues
with France, we may still be assured of their
ancient and confirmed partiality to us. America and
France <i>cannot</i> be congenial.</p>

<p>My Lords, to encourage and confirm that innate inclination
to this country, founded on every principle of
affection, as well as consideration of interest; to restore
that favorable disposition into a permanent and powerful
reunion with this country; to revive the mutual strength
of the empire; again to awe the House of Bourbon,
instead of meanly truckling, as our present calamities
compel us, to every insult of French caprice and Spanish
punctilio; to re-establish our commerce; to reassert our
rights and our honor; to confirm our interests, and
renew our glories forever<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a consummation most devoutly
to be endeavored! and which, I trust, may yet
arise from reconciliation with America<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I have the honor
of submitting to you the following amendment, which I
move to be inserted after the two first paragraphs of the
address:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And that this House does most humbly advise and
supplicate his Majesty to be pleased to cause the most
speedy and effectual measures to be taken for restoring
peace in America; and that no time may be lost in
proposing an immediate opening of a treaty for the final
settlement of the tranquillity of these invaluable provinces,
by a removal of the unhappy causes of this ruinous
civil war, and by a just and adequate security
against the return of the like calamities in times to
come. And this House desire to offer the most dutiful
assurances to his Majesty, that they will, in due time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cheerfully co-operate with the magnanimity and tender
goodness of his Majesty for the preservation of his
people, by such explicit and most solemn declarations,
and provisions of fundamental and irrevocable laws, as
may be judged necessary for the ascertaining and fixing
forever the respective rights of Great Britain and her
colonies."</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> might have been Sophia's sensations, the
rest of the family was easily consoled for Mr. Burchell's
absence by the company of our landlord, whose visits
now became more frequent and longer. Though he
had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the
amusements of the town, as he designed, he took every
opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations
which our retirement would admit of. He usually came
in the morning, and while my son and I followed our
occupations abroad, he sat with the family at home, and
amused them by describing the town, with every part of
which he was particularly acquainted. He could repeat
all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere
of the play-houses, and had all the good things of the
high wits by rote long before they made their way into
the jest-books. The intervals between conversation were
employed in teaching my daughters piquet, or sometimes
in setting my two little ones to box to make them <i>sharp</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as he called it; but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law,
in some measure blinded us to all his imperfections.
It must be owned that my wife laid a thousand schemes
to entrap him; or, to speak it more tenderly, used every
art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes
at tea ate short and crisp, they were made by Olivia: if
the gooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were
of her gathering: it was her fingers that gave the pickles
their peculiar green; and in the composition of a pudding,
it was her judgment that mixed the ingredients. Then
the poor woman would sometimes tell the 'squire, that
she thought him and Olivia extremely of a size, and
would bid both stand up to see which was tallest. These
instances of cunning, which she thought impenetrable,
yet which everybody saw through, were very pleasing to
our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of
his passion, which, though they had not risen to proposals
of marriage, yet we thought fell but little short of it; and
his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness,
and sometimes to his fear of offending his uncle.
An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put
it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of
our family; my wife even regarded it as an absolute
promise.</p>

<p>My wife and daughters happening to return a visit to
neighbor Flamborough's, found that family had lately
got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the
country, and took likenesses for fifteen shillings a head.
As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in
point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen
march upon us, and notwithstanding all I could say,
and I said much, it was resolved that we should have
our pictures done too. Having, therefore, engaged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
limner, for what could I do? our next deliberation was
to shew the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As
for our neighbor's family, there were seven of them, and
they were drawn with seven oranges, a thing quite out
of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the world.
We desired to have something in a brighter style, and
after many debates, at length came to an unanimous
resolution of being drawn together in one large historical
family piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame
would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more
genteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in
the same manner. As we did not immediately recollect
an historical subject to hit us, we were contented each
with being drawn as independent historical figures. My
wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter
was desired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her
stomacher and hair. Her two little ones were to be as
Cupids by her side, while I, with my gown and band,
was to present her with my books on the Whistonian
controversy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon,
sitting upon a bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph
richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia
was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as the
painter could put in for nothing; and Moses was to be
dressed out with an hat and white feather. Our taste so
much pleased the 'squire, that he insisted on being put
in as one of the family, in the character of Alexander
the Great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us
all as an indication of his desire to be introduced into
the family, nor could we refuse his request. The painter
was therefore set to work, and as he wrought with
assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the
whole was completed. The piece was large, and it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
be owned he did not spare his colors; for which my wife
gave him great encomiums. We were all perfectly
satisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate circumstance
had not occurred till the picture was finished,
which now struck us with dismay. It was so very large
that we had no place in the house to fix it. How we
all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable;
but certain it is, we had been all greatly remiss. The
picture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we
hoped, leaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the
kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and
painted, much too large to be got through any of the
doors, and the jest of all our neighbors. One compared
it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too large to be removed;
another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle;
some wondered how it could be got out, but still more
were amazed how it ever got in.</p>

<p>But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually
raised more malicious suggestions in many. The 'squire's
portrait being found united with ours, was an honor too
great to escape envy. Scandalous whispers began to
circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually
disturbed by persons who came as friends to
tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports
we always resented with becoming spirit; but scandal
ever improves by opposition.</p>

<p>We once again therefore entered into a consultation
upon obviating the malice of our enemies, and at last
came to a resolution which had too much cunning to
give me entire satisfaction. It was this: as our principal
object was to discover the honor of Mr. Thornhill's
addresses, my wife undertook to sound him by pretending
to ask his advice in the choice of an husband for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eldest daughter. If this was not found sufficient to
induce him to a declaration, it was then resolved to
terrify him with a rival. To this last step, however, I
would by no means give my consent, till Olivia gave me
the most solemn assurances that she would marry the
person provided to rival him upon this occasion, if he
did not prevent it, by taking her himself. Such was the
scheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose,
I did not entirely approve.</p>

<p>The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to
see us, my girls took care to be out of the way, in order
to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her
scheme in execution; but they only retired to the next
room, whence they could overhear the whole conversation:
my wife artfully introduced it, by observing, that one
of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a very good
match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the 'squire assenting,
she proceeded to remark, that they who had warm
fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands:
"But heaven help," continued she, "the girls that have
none. What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what
signifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the
world, in this age of self-interest? It is not, what is she?
but, what has she? is all the cry."</p>

<p>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice,
as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a
king, it should be otherwise. It should then, indeed, be
fine times for the girls without fortunes: our two young
ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be
facetious: but I wish I were a queen, and then I know
where my eldest daughter should look for an husband.
But now that you have put it into my head, seriously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Mr. Thornhill, can't you recommend me a proper husband
for her? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and
well educated, and, in my humble opinion, does not want
for parts."</p>

<p>"Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would
find out a person possessed of every accomplishment
that can make an angel happy. One with prudence,
fortune, taste, and sincerity; such, madam, would be, in
my opinion, the proper husband." "Ay, sir," said she,
"but do you know of any such person?"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"No, Madam,"
returned he, "it is impossible to know any person that
deserves to be her husband: she's too great a treasure
for one man's possession: she's a goddess. Upon my
soul, I speak what I think, she's an angel"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Ah, Mr.
Thornhill, you only flatter my poor girl: but we have
been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants,
whose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager;
you know whom I mean, farmer Williams; a warm man,
Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; and who has
several times made her proposals:" (which was actually
the case) "but, sir," concluded she, "I should be glad to
have your approbation of our choice."<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"How, Madam,"
replied he, "my approbation! My approbation of such
a choice! Never. What! Sacrifice so much beauty
and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the
blessing! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a
piece of injustice! And I have my reasons!"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Indeed,
sir," cried Deborah, "If you have your reasons, that's
another affair; but I should be glad to know those
reasons."<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Excuse me, madam," returned he, "they lie
too deep for discovery;" (laying his hand upon his
bosom) "they remain buried, rivetted here."</p>

<p>After he was gone, upon general consultation, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
could not tell what to make of these fine sentiments.
Olivia considered them as instances of the most exalted
passion; but I was not quite so sanguine: yet, whatever
they might portend, it was resolved to prosecute the
scheme of farmer Williams, who, from my daughter's
first appearance in the country, had paid her his
addresses.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">James Boswell</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1740-1795.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Life of Samuel Johnson, ll. d.</span></h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> now to record a very curious incident in Dr.
Johnson's life, which fell under my own observation; of
which <i>pars magna fui</i>, and which I am persuaded will,
with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.</p>

<p>My desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of
every description had made me, much about the same
time, obtain an introduction to Dr. Samuel Johnson and
to John Wilkes, Esq. Two men more different could
not perhaps be selected out of all mankind. They had
even attacked one another with some asperity in their
writings; yet I lived in habits of friendship with both.
I could fully relish the excellence of each; for I have
ever delighted in that intellectual chemistry, which can
separate good qualities from evil in the same person.</p>

<p>Sir John Pringle, "mine own friend and my father's
friend," between whom and Dr. Johnson I in vain wished
to establish an acquaintance, as I respected and lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
intimacy with both of them, observed to me once, very
ingeniously, "It is not in friendship as in mathematics,
where two things, each equal to a third, are equal between
themselves. You agree with Johnson as a middle
quality, and you agree with me as a middle quality; but
Johnson and I should not agree." Sir John was not
sufficiently flexible; so I desisted; knowing, indeed,
that the repulsion was equally strong on the part of
Johnson; who, I know not from what cause, unless his
being a Scotchman, had formed a very erroneous opinion
of Sir John. But I conceived an irresistible wish, if
possible, to bring Dr. Johnson and Mr. Wilkes together.
How to manage it, was a nice and difficult matter.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>My worthy booksellers and friends, Messieurs Dilly in
the Poultry, at whose hospitable and well-covered table
I have seen a greater number of literary men than at
any other, except that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, had invited
me to meet Mr. Wilkes and some more gentlemen
on Wednesday, May 15th. "Pray," said I, "let us have
Dr. Johnson." "What, with Mr. Wilkes? not for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
world," said Mr. Edward Dilly: "Dr. Johnson would
never forgive me." "Come," said I, "if you'll let me
negotiate for you, I will be answerable that all shall go
well." <i>Dilly.</i> "Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am
sure I shall be very happy to see them both here."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained
for Dr. Johnson, I was sensible that he was sometimes
a little actuated by the spirit of contradiction, and
by means of that I hoped I should gain my point. I
was persuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct
proposal, "Sir, will you dine in company with Jack
Wilkes?" he would have flown into a passion, and would
probably have answered, "Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir!
I'd as soon dine with Jack Ketch." I, therefore, while
we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an
evening, took occasion to open my plan thus: "Mr.
Dilly, Sir, sends his respectful compliments to you, and
would be happy if you would do him the honor to dine
with him on Wednesday next along with me, as I must
soon go to Scotland." <i>Johnson.</i> "Sir, I am obliged to
Mr. Dilly. I will wait upon him." <i>Boswell.</i> "Provided,
Sir, I suppose, that the company which he is to have is
agreeable to you?" <i>Johnson.</i> "What do you mean,
Sir? What do you take me for? Do you think I am
so ignorant of the world as to imagine that I am to
prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at
his table?" <i>Boswell.</i> "I beg your pardon, Sir, for
wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you
might not like. Perhaps he may have some of what he
calls his patriotic friends with him." <i>Johnson.</i> "Well,
Sir, and what then? What care I for his <i>patriotic
friends</i>? Poh!" <i>Boswell.</i> "I should not be surprised
to find Jack Wilkes there." <i>Johnson.</i> "And if Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Wilkes <i>should</i> be there, what is that to <i>me</i>, Sir? My
dear friend, let us have no more of this. I am sorry to
be angry with you; but really it is treating me strangely
to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever,
occasionally." <i>Boswell.</i> "Pray forgive me, Sir, I
meant well. But you shall meet whoever comes, for
me." Thus I secured him, and told Dilly that he would
find him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the
day appointed.</p>

<p>Upon the much expected Wednesday, I called on him
about half an hour before dinner, as I often did when we
were to dine out together, to see that he was ready in
time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting his
books, as upon a former occasion, covered with dust, and
making no preparation for going abroad. "How is this,
Sir?" said I. "Don't you recollect that you are to dine
at Mr. Dilly's?" <i>Johnson.</i> "Sir, I did not think of
going to Dilly's; it went out of my head. I have ordered
dinner at home with Mrs. Williams." <i>Boswell.</i>
"But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged to Mr.
Dilly, and I told him so. He will expect you, and will
be much disappointed if you don't come." <i>Johnson.</i>
"You must talk to Mrs Williams about this."</p>

<p>Here was a sad dilemma. I feared that what I was
so confident I had secured would yet be frustrated. He
had accustomed himself to show Mrs. Williams such a
degree of humane attention, as frequently imposed some
restraint upon him; and I knew that if she should be
obstinate, he would not stir. I hastened down stairs to
the blind lady's room, and told her I was in great uneasiness,
for Dr. Johnson had engaged to me to dine this
day at Mr. Dilly's, but that he had told me he had forgotten
his engagement, and had ordered dinner at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"Yes, Sir," said she, pretty peevishly, "Dr. Johnson is to
dine at home." "Madam," said I, "his respect for you is
such, that I know he will not leave you, unless you
absolutely desire it. But as you have so much of his
company, I hope you will be good enough to forego it
for a day, as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, has frequently
had agreeable parties at his house for Dr.
Johnson, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him
to-day. And then, Madam, be pleased to consider my
situation; I carried the message, and I assured Mr.
Dilly that Dr. Johnson was to come; and no doubt he
has made a dinner, and invited a company, and boasted
of the honor he expected to have. I shall be quite disgraced
if the Doctor is not there." She gradually
softened to my solicitations, which were certainly as earnest
as most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion, and
was graciously pleased to empower me to tell Dr. Johnson,
"That all things considered, she thought he should
certainly go." I flew back to him, still in dust, and
careless of what should be the event, "indifferent in his
choice to go or stay"; but as soon as I had announced
to him Mrs. Williams's consent, he roared, "Frank, a
clean shirt," and was very soon dressed. When I had
him fairly seated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted
as much as a fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into
a post-chaise with him to set out for Gretna Green.</p>

<p>When we entered Mr. Dilly's drawing room, he found
himself in the midst of a company he did not know. I
kept myself snug and silent, watching how he would conduct
himself. I observed him whispering to Mr. Dilly,
"Who is that gentleman, Sir?"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Mr. Arthur Lee."
<i>Johnson.</i> "Too, too, too" (under his breath), which was
one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. Arthur Lee could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
not but be very obnoxious to Johnson, for he was not
only a <i>patriot</i>, but an <i>American</i>. He was afterwards
minister from the United States at the court of Madrid.
"And who is the gentleman in lace?"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Mr. Wilkes,
Sir." This information confounded him still more; he
had some difficulty to restrain himself, and, taking up a
book, sat down upon a window-seat and read, or at least
kept his eye upon it intently for some time, till he composed
himself. His feelings, I dare say, were awkward
enough. But he had no doubt recollected his having
rated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted
by any company, and he, therefore, resolutely set
himself to behave quite as an easy man of the world,
who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and
manners of those whom he might chance to meet.</p>

<p>The cheering sound of "Dinner is upon the table,"
dissolved his reverie, and we <i>all</i> sat down without any
symptoms of ill humor.... Mr. Wilkes placed himself
next to Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much
attention and politeness, that he gained upon him insensibly.
No man ate more heartily than Johnson, or
loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes
was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal.
"Pray give me leave, Sir<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>It is better here<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>A little of
the brown<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Some fat, Sir<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>A little of the stuffing<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Some
gravy<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Let me have the pleasure of giving you
some butter<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this
orange; or the lemon, perhaps may have more zest"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Sir;
sir, I am obliged to you, Sir," cried Johnson,
bowing, and turning his head to him with a look for
some time of "surly virtue," but, in a short while of
complacency.</p>

<p>Foote being mentioned, Johnson said, "He is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
good mimic." One of the company added, "A merry-andrew,
a buffoon." <i>Johnson.</i> "But he has wit too, and
is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety
of imagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge
enough to fill up his part. One species of wit he
has in an eminent degree, that of escape. You drive him
into a corner with both hands; but he is gone, Sir, when
you think you have got him<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>like an animal that jumps
over your head. Then he has a great range for wit;
he never lets truth stand between him and the jest, and
he is sometimes mighty coarse. Garrick is under many
restraints from which Foote is free." <i>Wilkes.</i> "Garrick's
wit is more like Lord Chesterfield's." <i>Johnson.</i> "The
first time I was in company with Foote was at
Fitzherbert's. Having no good opinion of the fellow, I
was resolved not to be pleased; and it is very difficult
to please a man against his will. I went on eating my
dinner pretty sullenly, affecting not to mind him. But
the dog was so very comical, that I was obliged to lay
down my knife and fork, throw myself back in my chair,
and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irresistible. He
upon one occasion experienced, in an extraordinary
degree, the efficacy of his powers of entertaining.
Amongst the many and various modes which he tried of
getting money, he became a partner with a small-beer
brewer, and he was to have a share of the profits for
procuring customers amongst his numerous acquaintance.
Fitzherbert was one who took his small-beer, but
it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink it.
They were at some loss how to notify their resolution,
being afraid of offending their master, who, they knew,
liked Foote much as a companion. At last they fixed
upon a little black boy, who was rather a favorite, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
their deputy, and deliver their remonstrance; and, having
invested him with the sole authority of the kitchen, he
was to inform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a
certain day, that they would drink Foote's small-beer no
longer. On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert's,
and this boy served at table; he was so
delighted with Foote's stories, and merriment, and
grimace, that when he went down stairs, he told them,
'This is the finest man I have ever seen. I will not deliver
your message. I will drink his small-beer.'"</p>

<p>... Mr. Wilkes remarked, that "among all the bold
flights of Shakespeare's imagination, the boldest was
making Birnam-wood march to Dunsinane; creating a
wood where there never was a shrub; a wood in Scotland!
ha! ha! ha!" And he also observed, that "the
clannish slavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the
single exception to Milton's remark of 'the mountain
nymph, sweet Liberty,' being worshipped in all hilly
countries." "When I was at Inverary," said he, "on a
visit to my old friend Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his
dependents congratulated me on being such a favorite of
his Grace. I said, 'It is, then, gentlemen, truly lucky
for me; for if I had displeased the Duke, and he had
wished it, there is not a Campbell among you but would
have been ready to bring John Wilkes's head to him in
a charger. It would have been only</p>

<p class="center">"'Off with his head! so much for <i>Aylesbury</i>.'</p>

<p>"I was then member for Aylesbury."</p>

<p>... Mr. Arthur Lee mentioned some Scotch who had
taken possession of a barren part of America, and
wondered why they should choose it. <i>Johnson.</i> "Why,
Sir, all barrenness is comparative. The <i>Scotch</i> would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
know it to be barren." <i>Boswell.</i> "Come, come, he is
flattering the English. You have now been in Scotland,
Sir, and say if you did not see meat and drink enough
there." <i>Johnson.</i> "Why, yes, Sir; meat and drink
enough to give the inhabitants sufficient strength to run
away from home." All these quick and lively sallies
were said sportively, quite in jest, and with a smile,
which showed that he meant only wit. Upon this topic
he and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly assimilate; here was
a bond of union between them, and I was conscious that
as both of them had visited Caledonia, both were fully
satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who
imagine that it is a land of famine. But they amused
themselves with persevering in the old jokes. When I
claimed a superiority for Scotland over England in one
respect, that no man can be arrested there for a debt
merely because another swears it against him; but there
must first be the judgment of a court of law ascertaining
its justice; and that a seizure of the person, before
judgment is obtained, can take place only if his creditor
should swear that he is about to fly from the country, or,
as it is technically expressed, is <i>in meditatione fug</i><ins class="translit" title="ae ligature"><i>&#230;</i></ins>;<ins class="translit" title="em dash"><i>&#8212;</i></ins><i>Wilkes.</i>
"That, I should think, may be safely sworn of
all the Scotch nation." <i>Johnson</i> (to Mr. Wilkes). "You
must know, Sir, I lately took my friend Boswell, and
showed him genuine civilized life in an English provincial
town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, my native
city, that he might see for once real civility; for you
know he lives among savages in Scotland and among
rakes in London." <i>Wilkes.</i> "Except when he is with
grave, sober, decent people, like you and me." <i>Johnson</i>
(smiling). "And we ashamed of him."</p>

<p>... This record, though by no means so perfect as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could wish, will serve to give a notion of a very curious
interview, which was not only pleasing at the time, but
had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling
any animosity, and sweetening any acidity, which, in the
various bustle of political contest, had been produced in
the minds of two men, who, though widely different, had
so many things in common<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>classical learning, modern
literature, wit and humor, and ready repartee<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that it
would have been much to be regretted if they had been
forever at a distance from each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Burke gave me much credit for this successful
<i>negotiation</i>; and pleasantly said, "that there was nothing
equal to it in the whole history of the <i>corps diplomatique</i>."</p>

<p>I attended Dr. Johnson home, and had the satisfaction
to hear him tell Mrs. Williams how much he had been
pleased with Mr. Wilkes's company, and what an agreeable
day he had passed.<br /><br /></p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;" class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Johnson's dislike of Mr. Wilkes was so great that it extended even to his
connections. He happened to dine one day at Sir Joshua Reynolds's with a
large and distinguished company, amongst whom were Mr. Wilkes's brother,
Israel, and his lady. In the course of conversation, Mr. Israel Wilkes was
about to make some remark, when Johnson suddenly stopped him with, "I
hope, sir, what you are going to say may be better worth hearing than what
you have already said." This rudeness shocked and spread a gloom over the
whole party, particularly as Mr. Israel Wilkes was a gentleman of a very
amiable character and of refined taste, and, what Dr. Johnson little suspected,
a very loyal subject. Johnson afterwards owned to me that he was very sorry
that he had "<i>snubbed</i> Wilkes, as his wife was present." I replied, that he
should be sorry for many reasons. "No," said Johnson, who was very reluctant
to apologize for offences of this nature; "no, I only regret it because his
wife was by." I believe that he had no kind of motive for this incivility to Mr.
Israel Wilkes but disgust at his brother's political principles.

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Edward Gibbon</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1737-1794.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the second century of the Christian era, the empire
of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and
the most civilized portion of mankind. The frontiers of
that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown
and disciplined valor. The gentle but powerful
influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented
the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury.
The image of a free constitution was preserved with
decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess
the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors
all the executive powers of government. During a
happy period of more than fourscore years, the public
administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities
of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines.</p>

<p>The principal conquests of the Romans were achieved
under the republic; and the emperors, for the most part,
were satisfied with preserving those dominions which
had been acquired by the policy of the senate, the
active emulation of the consuls, and the martial enthusiasm
of the people. The seven first centuries were
filled with a rapid succession of triumphs; but it was
reserved for Augustus to relinquish the ambitious design
of subduing the whole earth, and to introduce a spirit
of moderation into the public councils. Inclined to
peace by his temper and situation, it was easy for him
to discover that Rome, in her present exalted situation,
had much less to hope than to fear from the chance of
arms; and that, in the prosecution of remote wars, the
undertaking became every day more difficult, the event
more doubtful, and the possession more precarious and
less beneficial. The experience of Augustus added
weight to these salutary reflections, and effectually convinced
him that, by the prudent vigor of his counsels, it
would be easy to secure every concession which the
safety or the dignity of Rome might require from the
most formidable barbarians. Instead of exposing his
person and his legions to the arrows of the Parthians, he
obtained, by an honorable treaty, the restitution of the
standards and prisoners which had been taken in the
defeat of Crassus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted
the reduction of <ins class="translit" title="AE ligature">&#198;</ins>thiopia and Arabia Felix. They
marched near a thousand miles to the south of the
tropic; but the heat of the climate soon repelled the invaders,
and protected the unwarlike natives of those
sequestered regions. The northern countries of Europe
scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest.
The forests and morasses of Germany were filled with a
hardy race of barbarians, who despised life when it was
separated from freedom; and though, on the first attack,
they seemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power,
they soon, by a signal act of despair, regained their
independence, and reminded Augustus of the vicissitude
of fortune. On the death of that emperor, his testament
was publicly read in the senate. He bequeathed, as a
valuable legacy to his successors, the advice of confining
the empire within those limits which nature seemed to
have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries:
on the west the Atlantic Ocean; the Rhine and Danube
on the north; the Euphrates on the east; and towards
the south, the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa.</p>

<p>Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system
recommended by the wisdom of Augustus was
adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors.
Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure, or in the
exercise of tyranny, the first C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sars seldom showed themselves
to the armies or to the provinces; nor were they
disposed to suffer that those triumphs which <i>their</i> indolence
neglected should be usurped by the conduct and
valor of their lieutenants. The military fame of a subject
was considered as an insolent invasion of the imperial
prerogative; and it became the duty, as well as interest,
of every Roman general to guard the frontiers intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to his care, without aspiring to conquests which might
have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished
barbarians.</p>

<p>The only accession which the Roman empire received
during the first century of the Christian era was the
province of Britain. In this single instance the successors
of C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar and Augustus were persuaded to follow
the example of the former, rather than the precept of
the latter. The proximity of its situation to the coast
of Gaul seemed to invite their arms; the pleasing,
though doubtful, intelligence of a pearl-fishery attracted
their avarice; and as Britain was viewed in the light of
a distinct and insulated world, the conquest scarcely
formed any exception to the general system of continental
measures. After a war of about forty years,
undertaken by the most stupid, maintained by the most
dissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all the
emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to
the Roman yoke. The various tribes of Britons possessed
valor without conduct, and the love of freedom
without the spirit of union. They took up arms with
savage fierceness; they laid them down, or turned them
against each other, with wild inconstancy; and while
they fought singly, they were successively subdued.
Neither the fortitude of Caractacus, nor the despair of
Boadicea, nor the fanaticism of the Druids, could avert
the slavery of their country, or resist the steady progress
of the imperial generals, who maintained the national
glory, when the throne was disgraced by the weakest or
the most vicious of mankind. At the very time when
Domitian, confined to his palace, felt the terrors which
he inspired, his legions, under the command of the virtuous
Agricola, defeated the collected force of the Cale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>donians
at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his fleets,
venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous navigation,
displayed the Roman arms round every part of the
island. The conquest of Britain was considered as already
achieved; and it was the design of Agricola to
complete and insure his success by the easy reduction of
Ireland, for which, in his opinion, one legion and a few
auxiliaries were sufficient. The western isle might be
improved into a valuable possession, and the Britons
would wear their chains with the less reluctance, if the
prospect and example of freedom was on every side removed
from before their eyes.</p>

<p>But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his
removal from the government of Britain; and forever
disappointed this rational, though extensive, scheme of
conquest. Before his departure the prudent general had
provided for security as well as for dominion. He had
observed that the island is almost divided into two unequal
parts by the opposite gulfs, or, as they are now called, the
Friths of Scotland. Across the narrow interval of about
forty miles he had drawn a line of military stations,
which was afterwards fortified, in the reign of Antoninus
Pius, by a turf rampart, erected on foundations of stone.
This wall of Antoninus, at a small distance beyond the
modern cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, was fixed as
the limit of the Roman province. The native Caledonians
preserved, in the northern extremity of the
island, their wild independence, for which they were not
less indebted to their poverty than to their valor. Their
incursions were frequently repelled and chastised, but
their country was never subdued. The masters of the
fairest and most wealthy climates of the globe turned
with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
tempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and from
cold and lonely heaths, over which the deer of the forest
were chased by a troop of naked barbarians.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the Roman frontiers, and such
the maxims of imperial policy, from the death of Augustus
to the accession of Trajan.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Edmund Burke</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1729-1797.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one thing I can excuse the Duke of Bedford for his
attack upon me and my mortuary pension: He cannot
readily comprehend the transaction he condemns. What
I have obtained was the fruit of no bargain, the production
of no intrigue, the result of no compromise, the effect
of no solicitation. The first suggestion of it never came
from me, mediately or immediately, to his Majesty or
any of his ministers. It was long known that the instant
my engagements would permit it, and before the
heaviest of all calamities had forever condemned me to
obscurity and sorrow, I had resolved on a total retreat.
I had executed that design. I was entirely out of the
way of serving or of hurting any statesman or any
party, when the ministers so generously and so nobly
carried into effect the spontaneous bounty of the crown.
Both descriptions have acted as became them. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
could no longer serve them, the ministers have considered
my situation. When I could no longer hurt them, the
revolutionists have trampled on my infirmity. My
gratitude, I trust, is equal to the manner in which the
benefit was conferred. It came to me, indeed, at a time
of life, and in a state of mind and body, in which no
circumstance of fortune could afford me any real pleasure.
But this was no fault in the royal donor, or in his
ministers, who were pleased, in acknowledging the merits
of an invalid servant of the public, to assuage the sorrows
of a desolate old man....</p>

<p>I was not like his Grace of Bedford, swaddled, and
rocked, and dandled into a legislator: "<i>Nitor in adversum</i>"
is the motto for a man like me. I possessed not one of
the qualities, nor cultivated one of the arts, that recommend
men to the favor and protection of the great. I
was not made for a minion or a tool. As little did I
follow the trade of winning the hearts by imposing on
the understandings of the people. At every step of my
progress in life<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for in every step was I traversed and
opposed<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and at every turnpike I met, I was obliged to
shew my passport, and again and again to prove my sole
title to the honor of being useful to my country, by a
proof that I was not wholly unacquainted with its laws,
and the whole system of its interests both abroad and at
home. Otherwise, no rank, no toleration even, for me.
I had no arts but manly arts. On them I have stood,
and, please God, in spite of the Duke of Bedford and the
Earl of Lauderdale, to the last gasp will I stand....</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford conceives that he is obliged to
call the attention of the House of Peers to his Majesty's
grant to me, which he considers as excessive and out of
all bounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>I know not how it has happened, but it really seems,
that, whilst his Grace was meditating his well-considered
censure upon me, he fell into a sort of sleep. Homer
nods, and the Duke of Bedford may dream; and as
dreams<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>even his golden dreams<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>are apt to be ill-pieced
and incongruously put together, his Grace preserved
his idea of reproach to <i>me</i>, but took the subject-matter
from the crown grants to <i>his own family</i>. This
is "the stuff of which his dreams are made." In that
way of putting things together, his Grace is perfectly in
the right. The grants to the house of Russell were so
enormous, as not only to outrage economy, but even to
stagger credibility. The Duke of Bedford is the leviathan
among all the creatures of the crown. He tumbles
about his unwieldy bulk; he plays and frolics in the
ocean of the royal bounty. Huge as he is, and whilst
"he lies floating many a rood," he is still a creature. His
ribs, his fins, his whalebone, his blubber, the very spiracles
through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his
origin, and covers me all over with the spray<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>everything
of him and about him is from the throne. Is it for
<i>him</i> to question the dispensation of the royal favor?</p>

<p>I really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel
between the public merits of his Grace, by which he
justifies the grants he holds, and these services of mine,
on the favorable construction of which I have obtained
what his Grace so much disapproves. In private life I
have not at all the honor of acquaintance with the noble
Duke; but I ought to presume, and it costs me nothing
to do so, that he abundantly deserves the esteem and
love of all who live with him. But as to public service,
why, truly, it would not be more ridiculous for me to
compare myself, in rank, in fortune, in splendid descent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in youth, strength, or figure, with the Duke of Bedford,
than to make a parallel between his services and my
attempts to be useful to my country. It would not be
gross adulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any
public merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the
services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained.
My merits, whatever they are, are original and personal:
his are derivative. It is his ancestor, the original pensioner,
that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit,
which makes his Grace so very delicate and exceptious
about the merit of all other grantees of the crown.
Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I should have
said: "'Tis his estate; that's enough. It is his by law;
what have I to do with it or its history?" He would
naturally have said on his side: "'Tis this man's fortune.
He is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred
and fifty years ago. I am a young man with very old
pensions: he is an old man with very young pensions<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that's
all."</p>

<p>Why will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly
to compare my little merit with that which
obtained from the crown those prodigies of profuse
donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of
humble and laborious individuals?... Since the
new grantees have war made on them by the old, and
that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken, let us
turn our eyes to history, in which great men have always
a pleasure in contemplating the heroic origin of their
house.</p>

<p>The first peer of the name, the first purchaser of the
grants, was a Mr. Russell, a person of an ancient gentleman's
family, raised by being a minion of Henry the
Eighth. As there generally is some resemblance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
character to create these relations, the favorite was in all
likelihood much such another as his master. The first of
those immoderate grants was not taken from the ancient
demesne of the crown, but from the recent confiscation
of the ancient nobility of the land. The lion, having
sucked the blood of his prey, threw the offal carcass to
the jackal in waiting. Having tasted once the food of
confiscation, the favorites became fierce and ravenous.
This worthy favorite's first grant was from the lay nobility.
The second, infinitely improving on the enormity
of the first, was from the plunder of the church. In
truth, his Grace is somewhat excusable for his dislike to
a grant like mine, not only in its quantity, but in its
kind, so different from his own.</p>

<p>Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign: his,
from Henry the Eighth. Mine had not its fund in the
murder of any innocent person of illustrious rank, or in
the pillage of any body of unoffending men: his grants
were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments
iniquitously legal, and from possessions voluntarily
surrendered by the lawful proprietors with the
gibbet at their door.</p>

<p>The merit of the grantee whom he derives from, was
that of being a prompt and greedy instrument of a
levelling tyrant, who oppressed all descriptions of his
people, but who fell with particular fury on everything
that was great and noble. Mine has been in endeavoring
to screen every man, in every class, from oppression, and
particularly in defending the high and eminent, who, in
the bad times of confiscating princes, confiscating chief-governors,
or confiscating demagogues, are the most exposed
to jealousy, avarice, and envy.</p>

<p>The merit of the original grantee of his Grace's pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>sions
was in giving his hand to the work, and partaking
the spoil with a prince who plundered a part of the
national church of his time and country. Mine was in
defending the whole of the national church of my own
time and my own country, and the whole of the national
churches of all countries, from the principles and the
examples which lead to ecclesiastical pillage, thence to
a contempt of <i>all</i> prescriptive titles, thence to the pillage
of <i>all</i> property, and thence to universal desolation.</p>

<p>The merit of the origin of his Grace's fortune was in
being a favorite and chief adviser to a prince who left no
liberty to his native country. My endeavor was to obtain
liberty for the municipal country in which I was born,
and for all descriptions and denominations in it. Mine
was to support, with unrelaxing vigilance, every right,
every privilege, every franchise, in this my adopted, my
dearer, and more comprehensive country; and not only
to preserve those rights in this chief seat of empire, but
in every nation, in every land, in every climate, language,
and religion, in the vast domain that still is under the
protection, and the larger that was once under the protection,
of the British crown.</p>

<p>His founder's merits were, by arts in which he served
his master and made his fortune, to bring poverty,
wretchedness, and depopulation on his country. Mine
were under a benevolent prince, in promoting the commerce,
manufactures, and agriculture of his kingdom.</p>

<p>His founder's merit was the merit of a gentleman
raised by the arts of a court and the protection of a
Wolsey to the eminence of a great and potent lord.
His merit in that eminence was, by instigating a tyrant
to injustice, to provoke a people to rebellion. My merit
was, to awaken the sober part of the country, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
might put themselves on their guard against any one
potent lord, or any greater number of potent lords, or
any combination of great leading men of any sort, if
ever they should attempt to proceed in the same courses,
but in the reverse order,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is, by instigating a corrupted
populace to rebellion, and, through that rebellion,
introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny which
his Grace's ancestor supported, and of which he profited
in the manner we behold in the despotism of Henry the
Eighth.</p>

<p>The political merit of the first pensioner of his Grace's
house was that of being concerned as a counsellor of
state in advising, and in his person executing, the conditions
of a dishonorable peace with France,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the surrendering
of the fortress of Boulogne, then our outguard on
the Continent. By that surrender, Calais, the key of
France, and the bridle in the mouth of that power, was
not many years afterwards finally lost. My merit has
been in resisting the power and pride of France, under
any form of its rule; but in opposing it with the
greatest zeal and earnestness, when that rule appeared in
the worst form it could assume,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the worst, indeed,
which the prime cause and principle of all evil could
possibly give it. It was my endeavor by every means to
excite a spirit in the House, where I had the honor of a
seat, for carrying on with early vigor and decision the
most clearly just and necessary war that this or any
nation ever carried on, in order to save my country from
the iron yoke of its power, and from the more dreadful
contagion of its principles,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>to preserve, while they can
be preserved, pure and untainted, the ancient, inbred
integrity, piety, good-nature, and good-humor of the
people of England, from the dreadful pestilence which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
beginning in France, threatens to lay waste the whole
moral and in a great degree the whole physical world,
having done both in the focus of its most intense malignity.</p>

<p>The labors of his Grace's founder merited the "curses,
not loud, but deep," of the Commons of England, on
whom <i>he</i> and his master had effected a <i>complete Parliamentary
Reform</i>, by making them, in their slavery
and humiliation, the true and adequate representatives
of a debased, degraded, and undone people. My merits
were in having had an active, though not always an
ostentatious share, in every one act, without exception,
of undisputed constitutional utility in my time, and in
having supported, on all occasions, the authority, the
efficiency, and the privileges of the Commons of Great
Britain. I ended my services by a recorded and fully
reasoned assertion on their own journals of their constitutional
rights, and a vindication of their constitutional
conduct. I labored in all things to merit their inward
approbation, and (along with the assistants of the largest,
the greatest, and best of my endeavors) I received their
free, unbiased, public, and solemn thanks.</p>

<p>Thus stands the account of the comparative merits of
the crown grants which compose the Duke of Bedford's
fortune, as balanced against mine.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 20em;">Nov. 17th, 1783.</span></p>

<p>... <span class="smcap">Since</span> our conflagration here, we have sent two
women and a boy to the justice, for depredation; S. R.
for stealing a piece of beef, which, in her excuse, she said
she intended to take care of. This lady, whom you well
remember, escaped for want of evidence; not that evidence
was wanting, but our men of Gotham judged it unnecessary
to send it. With her went the woman I mentioned
before, who, it seems, has made some sort of profession, but
upon this occasion allowed herself a latitude of conduct
rather inconsistent with it, having filled her apron with
wearing-apparel, which she likewise intended to take care
of. She would have gone to the county gaol, had
William Raban, the baker's son, who prosecuted, insisted
upon it; but he, good-naturedly, though I think weakly,
interposed in her favor, and begged her off. The young
gentleman who accompanied these fair ones is the junior
son of Molly Boswell. He had stolen some iron-work,
the property of Griggs the butcher. Being convicted,
he was ordered to be whipped, which operation he underwent
at the cart's tail, from the stone-house to the high
arch, and back again. He seemed to show great fortitude,
but it was all an imposition upon the public. The
beadle, who performed it, had filled his left hand with
yellow ochre, through which, after every stroke, he drew
the lash of his whip, leaving the appearance of a wound
upon the skin, but in reality not hurting him at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
This being perceived by Mr. Constable H., who followed
the beadle, he applied his cane, without any such management
or precaution, to the shoulders of the too
merciful executioner. The scene immediately became
more interesting. The beadle could by no means be
prevailed upon to strike hard, which provoked the constable
to strike harder; and this double flogging continued,
till a lass of Silver-End, pitying the pitiful
beadle thus suffering under the hands of the pitiless
constable, joined the procession, and placing herself
immediately behind the latter, seized him by his capillary
club, and pulling him backwards by the same,
slapped his face with a most Amazon fury. This concatenation
of events has taken up more of my paper
than I intended it should, but I could not forbear to
inform you how the beadle thrashed the thief, the constable
the beadle, and the lady the constable, and how the
thief was the only person concerned who suffered nothing.</p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 20em;">March 29th, 1784.</span></p>

<p>It being his Majesty's pleasure, that I should yet have
another opportunity to write before he dissolves the
Parliament, I avail myself of it with all possible alacrity.
I thank you for your last, which was not the less welcome
for coming, like an extraordinary gazette, at a time when
it was not expected.</p>

<p>As when the sea is uncommonly agitated, the water
finds its way into creeks and holes of rocks, which in its
calmer state it never reaches, in like manner the effect of
these turbulent times is felt even at Orchard Side, where
in general we live as undisturbed by the political element
as shrimps or cockles that have been accidentally
deposited in some hollow beyond the water-mark, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
usual dashing of the waves. We were sitting yesterday
after dinner, the two ladies and myself, very composedly,
and without the least apprehension of any such
intrusion in our snug parlor, one lady knitting, the other
netting, and the gentleman winding worsted, when to our
unspeakable surprise a mob appeared before the window;
a smart rap was heard at the door, the boys bellowed,
and the maid announced Mr. Grenville. Puss was unfortunately
let out of her box, so that the candidate,
with all his good friends at his heels, was refused admittance
at the grand entry, and referred to the back door,
as the only possible way of approach.</p>

<p>Candidates are creatures not very susceptible of affronts,
and would rather, I suppose, climb in at the
window, than be absolutely excluded. In a minute, the
yard, the kitchen, and the parlor were filled. Mr. Grenville,
advancing toward me, shook me by the hand with
a degree of cordiality that was extremely seducing. As
soon as he, and as many more as could find chairs, were
seated, he began to open the intent of his visit. I told
him I had no vote, for which he readily gave me credit.
I assured him I had no influence, which he was not
equally inclined to believe, and the less, no doubt, because
Mr. Ashburner, the draper, addressing himself to
me at this moment, informed me that I had a great deal.
Supposing that I could not be possessed of such a treasure
without knowing it, I ventured to affirm my first
assertion, by saying, that if I had any I was utterly at a
loss to imagine where it could be, or wherein it consisted.
Thus ended the conference. Mr. Grenville squeezed me
by the hand again, kissed the ladies, and withdrew. He
kissed likewise the maid in the kitchen, and seemed
upon the whole a most loving, kissing, kind-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
gentleman. He is very young, genteel, and handsome.
He has a pair of very good eyes in his head, which not
being sufficient, as it should seem, for the many nice and
difficult purposes of a senator, he has a third also, which
he suspended from his buttonhole. The boys halloo'd,
the dogs barked, puss scampered, the hero, with his long
train of obsequious followers, withdrew. We made ourselves
very merry with the adventure, and in a short
time settled into our former tranquillity, never probably
to be thus interrupted more. I thought myself, however,
happy in being able to affirm truly that I had not that
influence for which he sued; and which, had I been
possessed of it, with my present views of the dispute
between the Crown and the Commons, I must have refused
him, for he is on the side of the former. It is
comfortable to be of no consequence in a world where
one cannot exercise any without disobliging somebody.
The town, however, seems to be much at his service, and
if he be equally successful throughout the country, he
will undoubtedly gain his election. Mr. Ashburner, perhaps,
was a little mortified, because it was evident I
owed the honor of this visit to his misrepresentation of
my importance. But had he thought proper to assure
Mr. Grenville that I had three heads, I should not, I suppose,
have been bound to produce them....</p>

going to church, and fairly quarrelled before the bells had
done ringing. I was more than once nearly choked with
gall during the honeymoon, and had lost all comfort in
life before my friends had done wishing me joy. Yet I
chose with caution<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a girl bred wholly in the country,
who never knew luxury beyond one silk gown, nor
dissipation above the annual gala of a race ball. Yet
she now plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies
of fashion and the town with as ready a grace as if she
never had seen a bush or a grass-plot out of Grosvenor
Square! I am sneered at by all my acquaintance, and
paragraphed in the newspapers. She dissipates my
fortune, and contradicts all my humors; yet the worst
of it is, I doubt I love her, or I should never bear all
this. However, I'll never be weak enough to own it.
But I meet with nothing but crosses and vexations<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
the fault is entirely hers. I am, myself, the sweetest-tempered
man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and so
I tell her a hundred times a day.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Ay! and what is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
extraordinary, in all our disputes she is always in the
wrong. But Lady Sneerwell, and the set she meets at
her house, encourage the perverseness of her disposition.
Then, to complete my vexation, Maria, my ward, whom
I ought to have the power of a father over, is determined
to turn rebel too, and absolutely refuses the man
whom I have long resolved on for her husband<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Teazle</span>.</p>

<p>Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I'll not bear it!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or
not, as you please; but I ought to have my own way in
everything, and, what's more, I will too. What! though
I was educated in the country, I know very well that
women of fashion in London are accountable to nobody
after they are married.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Very well, ma'am, very well; so a husband is
to have no influence, no authority?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Authority! No, to be sure. If you
wanted authority over me, you should have adopted me,
and not married me: I am sure you were old enough.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Old enough!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>ay, there it is. Well, well,
Lady Teazle, though my life may be made unhappy by
your temper, I'll not be ruined by your extravagance!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more
extravagant than a woman of fashion ought to be.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> No, no, madam, you shall throw away no
more sums on such unmeaning luxury. Such wastefulness!
to spend as much to furnish your dressing-room
with flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon
into a greenhouse, and give a <i>f</i><ins class="translit" title="e circumflex"><i>&#234;</i></ins><i>te champ</i><ins class="translit" title="e circumflex"><i>&#234;</i></ins><i>tre</i> at
Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> And am I to blame, Sir Peter, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
flowers are dear in cold weather? You should find fault
with the climate, and not with me. For my part, I'm
sure I wish it was spring all the year round, and that
roses grew under our feet.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Oons! madam<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if you had been born to this,
I shouldn't wonder at your talking thus; but you forget
what your situation was when I married you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> No, no, I don't; 'twas a very disagreeable
one, or I should never have married you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat
a humbler style<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the daughter of a plain country squire.
Recollect, Lady Teazle, when I saw you first sitting at
your tambour, in a pretty figured linen gown, with a
bunch of keys at your side, your hair combed smooth
over a roll, and your apartment hung round with fruits
in worsted, of your own working.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Oh, yes! I remember it very well, and a
curious life I led. My daily occupation<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>to inspect the
dairy, superintend the poultry, make extracts from the
family receipt-book, and comb my aunt Deborah's lap-dog.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, yes, ma'am, 'twas so indeed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> And then you know my evening amusements!
To draw patterns for ruffles, which I had not
materials to make up; to play Pope Joan with the
curate; to read a sermon to my aunt; or to be stuck
down to an old spinet to strum my father to sleep after
a fox-chase.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes,
madam, these were the recreations I took you from; but
now you must have your coach<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>vis-</i><ins class="translit" title="a grave"><i>&#224;</i></ins><i>-vis</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and three
powdered footmen before your chair; and, in the summer,
a pair of white cats to draw you to Kensington Gardens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
No recollection, I suppose, when you were content to
ride double, behind the butler, on a docked coach-horse.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> No<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I vow I never did that: I deny the
butler and the coach-horse.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> This, madam, was your situation; and what
have I done for you? I have made you a woman of
fashion, of fortune, of rank<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in short, I have made you
my wife.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Well, then, and there is but one thing
more you can make me to add to the obligation, that
is<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins></p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> My widow, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Hem! hem!</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> I thank you, madam<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but don't flatter yourself;
for, though your ill conduct may disturb my peace
of mind, it shall never break my heart, I promise you:
however, I am equally obliged to you for the hint.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Then why will you endeavor to make
yourself so disagreeable to me, and thwart me in every
little elegant expense?</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Madam, I say, had you any of these little
elegant expenses when you married me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Sir Peter! would you have me be out of
the fashion?</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> The fashion, indeed! what had you to do
with the fashion before you married me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> For my part, I should think you would
like to have your wife thought a woman of taste.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ay<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>there again<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>taste! Zounds! madam,
you had no taste when you married me!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter! and
after having married you, I should never pretend to taste
again, I allow. But now, Sir Peter, since we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
finished our daily jangle, I presume I may go to my
engagement at Lady Sneerwell's.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ay, there's another precious circumstance<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a
charming set of acquaintances you have made there!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of rank
and fortune, and remarkably tenacious of reputation.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, they are tenacious of reputation with a
vengeance; for they don't choose anybody should have
a character but themselves! Such a crew! Ah! many
a wretch has rid on a hurdle who has done less mischief
than these utterers of forged tales; coiners of scandal,
and clippers of reputation.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> What, would you restrain the freedom of
speech?</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ah! they have made you just as bad as any
one of the society.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Why, I believe I do bear a part with a
tolerable grace.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Grace, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> But I vow I bear no malice against the
people I abuse; when I say an ill-natured thing, 'tis out
of pure good humor; and I take it for granted they deal
exactly in the same manner with me. But, Sir Peter,
you know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Well, well, I'll call in, just to look after my
own character.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Then, indeed, you must make haste after
me, or you'll be too late. So good-bye to ye.<br />
<span class="right">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> So<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I have gained much by my intended
expostulation! Yet with what a charming air she contradicts
everything I say; and how pleasantly she shows
her contempt for my authority! Well, though I can't
make her love me; there is great satisfaction in quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>ling
with her; and I think she never appears to such
advantage as when she is doing everything in her power
to plague me.<br />

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> I believe he'll wait on your ladyship presently.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Maria, my love, you look grave. Come,
you shall sit down to piquet with Mr. Surface.</p>

<p><i>Mar.</i> I take very little pleasure in cards<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>however, I'll

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Now I'll die; but you are so scandalous, I'll
forswear your society.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> What's the matter, Mrs. Candour?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> They'll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion
to be handsome.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Oh, surely she is a pretty woman.</p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> I am very glad you think so, ma'am.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> She has a charming fresh color.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Yes, when it is fresh put on.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Oh, fie! Her color is natural: I have seen
it come and go!</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> I dare say you have, ma'am: it goes off
at night, and comes again in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> True, ma'am, it not only comes and goes;
but, what's more, her maid can fetch and carry it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk
so! But surely now, her sister is, or was, very handsome.</p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> Who? Mrs. Evergreen? Oh! she's six-and-fifty
if she's an hour!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Now positively you wrong her; fifty-two
or fifty-three is the utmost<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and I don't think she looks
more.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Ah! there's no judging by her looks, unless
one could see her face.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Well, well, if Mrs. Evergreen does take
some pains to repair the ravages of time, you must allow
she effects it with great ingenuity; and surely that's
better than the careless manner in which the widow
Ochre caulks her wrinkles.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Nay, now, Lady Sneerwell, you are severe
upon the widow. Come, come, 'tis not that she paints so
ill<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but, when she has finished her face, she joins it on
so badly to her neck, that she looks like a mended statue,
in which the connoisseur may see at once that the head
is modern, though the trunk's antique.</p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Well said, nephew!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh;
but I vow I hate you for it. What do you think of Miss
Simper?</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Why, she has very pretty teeth.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Yes, and on that account, when she is
neither speaking nor laughing (which very seldom happens),
she never absolutely shuts her mouth, but leaves it
always on a-jar, as it were<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>thus.<br />
<span class="right">[<i>Shows her teeth.</i></span><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> How can you be so ill-natured?</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Nay, I allow even that's better than the
pains Mrs. Prim takes to conceal her losses in front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
She draws her mouth till it positively resembles the
aperture of a poor's-box, and all her words appear to
slide out edgewise as it were<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>thus: <i>How do you do,

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Very well, Lady Teazle; I see you can
be a little severe.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> In defence of a friend it is but justice.
But here comes Sir Peter to spoil our pleasantry.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Peter Teazle</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ladies, your most obedient.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>[<i>Aside,</i>] Mercy
on me, here is the whole set! a character dead at every
word, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter.
They have been so censorious<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and Lady Teazle as bad
as any one.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> That must be very distressing to you, indeed,
Mrs. Candour.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Oh, they will allow good qualities to nobody:
not even good nature to our friend Mrs. Pursy.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs.
Quadrille's last night?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Nay, her bulk is her misfortune; and, when
she takes so much pains to get rid of it, you ought not
to reflect on her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> That's very true, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teaz.</i> Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and
small whey; laces herself by pulleys; and often, in the
hottest noon in summer, you may see her on a little
squat pony, with her hair plaited up behind like a drummer's,
and puffing round the ring on a full trot.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> I thank you, Lady Teazle, for defending her.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, a good defence, truly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Truly, Lady Teazle is as censorious as Miss
Sallow.</p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> Yes, and she is a curious being to pretend to be
censorious<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>an awkward thing, without any one good
point under the sun.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Positively you shall not be so very severe.
Miss Sallow is a near relation of mine by marriage, and,
as for her person, great allowance is to be made; for, let
me tell you, a woman labors under many disadvantages
who tries to pass for a girl of six-and-thirty.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Though, surely, she is handsome still<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
for the weakness in her eyes, considering how much
she reads by candlelight, it is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> True, and then as to her manner; upon my
word I think it is particularly graceful, considering she
never had the least education; for you know her mother
was a Welsh milliner, and her father a sugar-baker at
Bristol.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, distressingly good-natured! This their
own relation! Mercy on me!<br />
<span class="right">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> For my part, I own I cannot bear to hear a
friend ill-spoken of.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> No, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Oh! you are of a moral turn. Mrs. Candour
and I can sit for an hour and hear Lady Stucco talk
sentiment.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teas.</i> Nay, I vow Lady Stucco is very well with
the dessert after dinner; for she's just like the French
fruit one cracks for mottoes<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>made up of paint and
proverb.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Well, I will never join in ridiculing a friend;
and so I constantly tell my cousin Ogle, and you all
know what pretensions she has to be critical on beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> Oh, to be sure! she has herself the oddest countenance
that ever was seen; 'tis a collection of features
from all the different countries of the globe.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> So she has, indeed<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>an Irish front<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins></p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> And teeth <ins class="translit" title="a grave"><i>&#224;</i></ins> <i>la Chinoise</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> In short, her face resembles a <i>table d'h</i><ins class="translit" title="o circumflex"><i>&#244;</i></ins><i>te</i> at

all the members, even to her eyes, appear to
have a different interest, and her nose and chin are the
only parties likely to join issue.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Ha! ha! ha!</p>

twice a week!<br />
<span class="right">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> Nay, but I vow you shall not carry the

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Madam, madam, I beg your pardon<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>there's
no stopping these good gentlemen's tongues. But when
I tell you, Mrs. Candour, that the lady they are abusing
is a particular friend of mine, I hope you'll not take her
part.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter! but
you are a cruel creature<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>too phlegmatic yourself for a
jest, and too peevish to allow wit in others.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ah, madam, true wit is more nearly allied to
good nature than your ladyship is aware of.</p>

<p><i>Lady Teas.</i> True, Sir Peter; I believe they are so
near akin that they can never be united.</p>

<p><i>Sir Ben.</i> Or rather, suppose them man and wife, because
one seldom sees them together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><i>Lady Teaz.</i> But Sir Peter is such an enemy to scandal,
I believe he would have it put down by parliament.</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Positively, madam, if they were to consider
the sporting with reputation of as much importance as
poaching on manors, and pass an act for the preservation
of fame, as well as game, I believe many would
thank them for the bill.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Why! Sir Peter; would you deprive us
of our privileges?</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Ay, madam; and then no person should be
permitted to kill characters and run down reputations
but qualified old maids and disappointed widows.</p>

<p><i>Lady Sneer.</i> Go, you monster!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Can.</i> But, surely, you would not be quite so
severe on those who only report what they hear?</p>

<p><i>Sir Pet.</i> Yes, madam, I would have law merchant for
them too; and in all cases of slander currency, whenever
the drawer of the lie was not to be found, the injured
parties should have a right to come on any of the
indorsers.</p>

<p><i>Crab.</i> Well, for my part, I believe there never was a
scandalous tale without some foundation.</p>

He wales<a name="FNanchor_36_44" id="FNanchor_36_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_44" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> a portion with judicious care;<br />
And "Let us worship God!" he says, with solemn air.<br /></p>

<p>They chant their artless notes in simple guise;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Perhaps "Dundee's" wild warbling measures rise,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Or plaintive "Martyrs," worthy of the name;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Or noble "Elgin" beets</span><a name="FNanchor_37_45" id="FNanchor_37_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_45" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the heavenward flame,<br />
The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Compar'd with these, Italian trills are tame;</span><br />
The tickled ears no heart-felt raptures raise;<br />
Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.</p>

<p>The priest-like father reads the sacred page<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">How Abram was the friend of God on high;</span><br />
Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">With Amalek's ungracious progeny;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Or how the royal bard did groaning lie</span><br />
Beneath the stroke of Heaven's avenging ire;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Or Job's pathetic plaint, and wailing cry;</span><br />
Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire;<br />
Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed;</span><br />
How He, who bore in Heaven the second name,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Had not on earth whereon to lay His head;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">How His first followers and servants sped;</span><br />
The precepts sage they wrote to many a land;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">How he, who lone in Patmos banish</span><ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d,<br />
Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand;<br />
And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by Heaven's command.</p>

<p>Then kneeling down, to Heaven's Eternal King,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The saint, the father, and the husband prays:</span><br />
Hope "springs exulting on triumphant wing,"<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">That thus they all shall meet in future days:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">There ever bask in uncreated rays,</span><br />
No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Together hymning their Creator's praise,</span><br />
In such society, yet still more dear;<br />
While circling time moves round in an eternal sphere.</p>

<p>Compar'd with this, how poor Religion's pride,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">In all the pomp of method, and of art,</span><br />
When men display to congregations wide<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Devotion's every grace, except the heart!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The Power, incens'd, the pageant will desert,</span><br />
The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">But, haply, in some cottage far apart,</span><br />
May hear, well pleas'd, the language of the soul;<br />
And in His book of life the inmates poor enroll.</p>

<p>Then homeward all take off their several way:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The youngling cottagers retire to rest;</span><br />
The parent-pair their secret homage pay,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And proffer up to Heaven the warm request</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">That He, who stills the raven's clam'rous nest,</span><br />
And decks the lily fair in flowery pride,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best,</span><br />
For them, and for their little ones provide;<br />
But chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.</p>

<p>From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">That makes her lov'd at home, rever'd abroad:</span><br />
Princes and lords are but the breath of kings;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"An honest man's the noblest work of God;"</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And certes, in fair virtue's heavenly road,</span><br />
The cottage leaves the palace far behind;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">What is a lordling's pomp?</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a cumbrous load,<br />
Disguising oft the wretch of human kind,<br />
Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refin'd!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
O Scotia! my dear, my native soil!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent!</span><br />
Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Be blest with health, and peace, and sweet content!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And, oh! may Heaven their simple lives prevent</span><br />
From luxury's contagion, weak and vile!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent,</span><br />
A virtuous populace may rise the while,<br />
And stand a wall of fire around their much-lov'd Isle.</p>

<p>O Thou! who pour'd the patriotic tide<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">That stream'd through Wallace's undaunted heart;</span><br />
Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Or nobly die, the second glorious part,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">(The patriot's God peculiarly Thou art,</span><br />
His friend, inspirer, guardian, and reward!)<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">O never, never, Scotia's realm desert;</span><br />
But still the patriot, and the patriot-bard,<br />
In bright succession raise, her ornament and guard.<br /><br /></p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Talisman</span>.</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1771-1832.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been agreed, on account of the heat of the
climate, that the judicial combat, which was the cause of
the present assemblage of various nations at the Diamond
of the Desert, should take place at one hour after sunrise.
The wide lists, which had been constructed under
the inspection of the Knight of the Leopard, enclosed a
space of hard sand, which was one hundred and twenty
yards long by forty in width. They extended in length
from north to south, so as to give both parties the equal
advantage of the rising sun. Saladin's royal seat was
erected on the western side of the enclosure, just in the
centre, where the combatants were expected to meet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
mid encounter. Opposed to this was a gallery with
closed casements, so contrived, that the ladies, for whose
accommodation it was erected, might see the fight
without being themselves exposed to view. At either
extremity of the lists was a barrier, which could be
opened or shut at pleasure. Thrones had been also
erected, but the Archduke, perceiving that his was lower
than King Richard's, refused to occupy it; and C<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>ur
de Lion, who would have submitted to much ere any
formality should have interfered with the combat, readily
agreed that the sponsors, as they were called, should
remain on horseback during the fight. At one extremity
of the lists were placed the followers of Richard, and
opposed to them were those who accompanied the
defender, Conrade. Around the throne destined for the
Soldan were ranged his splendid Georgian Guards, and
the rest of the enclosure was occupied by Christian and
Mohammedan spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Long before daybreak, the lists were surrounded by
even a larger number of Saracens than Richard had seen
on the preceding evening. When the first ray of the
sun's glorious orb arose above the desert, the sonorous
call, "To prayer, to prayer!" was poured forth by the
Soldan himself, and answered by others, whose rank and
zeal entitled them to act as muezzins. It was a striking
spectacle to see them all sink to earth, for the purpose
of repeating their devotions, with their faces turned to
Mecca. But when they arose from the ground, the sun's
rays, now strengthening fast, seemed to confirm the Lord
of Gilsland's conjecture of the night before. They were
flashed back from many a spear-head, for the pointless
lances of the preceding day were certainly no longer
such. De Vaux pointed it out to his master, who
answered with impatience, that he had perfect confidence
in the good faith of the Soldan; but if De Vaux was
afraid of his bulky body, he might retire.</p>

<p>Soon after this the noise of timbrels was heard, at the
sound of which the whole Saracen cavaliers threw themselves
from their horses, and prostrated themselves, as if
for a second morning prayer. This was to give an
opportunity to the Queen, with Edith and her attendants,
to pass from the pavilion to the gallery intended for
them. Fifty guards of Saladin's seraglio escorted them,
with naked sabres, whose orders were, to cut to pieces
whomsoever, were he prince or peasant, should venture
to gaze on the ladies as they passed, or even presume to
raise his head until the cessation of the music should
make all men aware that they were lodged in their
gallery, not to be gazed on by the curious eye.</p>

<p>This superstitious observance of Oriental reverence to
the fair sex called forth from Queen Berengaria some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
criticisms very unfavorable to Saladin and his country.
But their den, as the royal fair called it, being securely
closed and guarded by their sable attendants, she was
under the necessity of contenting herself with seeing,
and laying aside for the present the still more exquisite
pleasure of being seen.</p>

<p>Meantime the sponsors of both champions went, as
was their duty, to see that they were duly armed, and
prepared for combat. The Archduke of Austria was in
no hurry to perform this part of the ceremony, having
had rather an unusually severe debauch upon wine of
Schiraz the preceding evening. But the Grand Master
of the Temple, more deeply concerned in the event of
the combat, was early before the tent of Conrade of
Montserrat. To his great surprise, the attendants refused
him admittance.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me, ye knaves?" said the Grand
Master in great anger.</p>

<p>"We do, most valiant and reverend," answered Conrade's
squire; "but even <i>you</i> may not at present enter<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the
Marquis is about to confess himself."</p>

<p>"Confess himself!" exclaimed the Templar, in a tone
where alarm mingled with surprise and scorn<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"and to
whom I pray thee?"</p>

<p>"My master bid me be secret," said the squire; on
which the Grand Master pushed past him, and entered
the tent almost by force.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Montserrat was kneeling at the feet
of the Hermit of Engaddi, and in the act of beginning
his confession.</p>

<p>"What means this, Marquis?" said the Grand Master,
"up, for shame<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>or, if you must needs confess, am not I
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>"I have confessed to you too often already," replied
Conrade, with a pale cheek and a faltering voice. "For
God's sake, Grand Master, begone, and let me unfold my
conscience to this holy man."</p>

<p>"In what is he holier than I am?" said the Grand
Master.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Hermit, prophet, madman<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>say, if thou darest,
in what thou excellest me?"</p>

<p>"Bold and bad man," replied the Hermit, "know that
I am like the latticed window, and the divine light passes
through to avail others, though alas! it helpeth not me.
Thou art like the iron stanchions, which neither receive
light themselves, nor communicate it to any one."</p>

<p>"Prate not to me, but depart from this tent," said the
Grand Master; "the Marquis shall not confess this
morning, unless it be to me, for I part not from his side."</p>

<p>"Is this <i>your</i> pleasure?" said the Hermit to Conrade;
"for think not I will obey that proud man, if you continue
to desire my assistance."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Conrade irresolutely, "what would you
have me say? Farewell for a while<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>we will speak
anon."</p>

<p>"O, procrastination!" exclaimed the Hermit, "thou
art a soul-murderer!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Unhappy man, farewell; not for
a while, but until we both shall meet<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no matter where.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>And
for thee," he added, turning to the Grand Master,
"<span class="smcap">tremble</span>!"</p>

<p>"Tremble!" replied the Templar contemptuously, "I
cannot if I would."</p>

<p>The Hermit heard not his answer, having left the tent.</p>

<p>"Come! to this gear hastily," said the Grand Master,
"since thou wilt needs go through the foolery.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Hark
thee<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I think I know most of thy frailties by heart, so
we may omit the detail, which may be somewhat a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
one, and begin with the absolution. What signifies
counting the spots of dirt that we are about to wash
from our hands?"</p>

<p>"Knowing what thou art thyself," said Conrade, "it is
blasphemous to speak of pardoning another."</p>

<p>"That is not according to the canon, Lord Marquis,"
said the Templar; "thou art more scrupulous than
orthodox. The absolution of the wicked priest is as
effectual as if he were himself a saint; otherwise,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>God
help the poor penitent! What wounded man inquires
whether the surgeon that tents his gashes have clean
hands or not?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Come, shall we to this toy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Conrade, "I will rather die unconfessed
than mock the sacrament."</p>

<p>"Come, noble Marquis," said the Templar, "rouse up
your courage, and speak not thus. In an hour's time
thou shalt stand victorious in the lists, or confess thee in
thy helmet, like a valiant knight."</p>

<p>"Alas, Grand Master!" answered Conrade, "all augurs
ill for this affair. The strange discovery by the instinct
of a dog, the revival of this Scottish knight, who comes
into the lists like a spectre,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>all betokens evil."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said the Templar, "I have seen thee bend
thy lance boldly against him in sport, and with equal
chance of success. Think thou art but in a tournament,
and who bears him better in the tilt-yard than thou?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Come,
squires and armorers, your master must be accoutred
for the field."</p>

<p>The attendants entered accordingly, and began to arm
the Marquis.</p>

<p>"What morning is without?" said Conrade.</p>

<p>"The sun rises dimly," answered a squire.</p>

<p>"Thou seest, Grand Master," said Conrade, "naught
smiles on us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>"Thou wilt fight the more coolly, my son," answered
the Templar. "Thank Heaven that hath tempered the
sun of Palestine to suit thine occasion."</p>

<p>Thus jested the Grand Master; but his jests had lost
their influence on the harassed mind of the Marquis, and,
notwithstanding his attempts to seem gay, his gloom
communicated itself to the Templar.</p>

<p>"This craven," he thought, "will lose the day in pure
faintness and cowardice of heart, which he calls tender
conscience. I, whom visions and auguries shake not<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who
am firm in my purpose as the living rock<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I should
have fought the combat myself.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Would to God the
Scot may strike him dead on the spot; it were next
best to his winning the victory. But, come what will, he
must have no other confessor than myself. Our sins are
too much in common, and he might confess my share
with his own."</p>

<p>While these thoughts passed through his mind, he
continued to assist the Marquis in arming, but it was in
silence.</p>

<p>The hour at length arrived, the trumpets sounded, the
knights rode into the lists armed at all points, and
mounted like men who were to do battle for a kingdom's
honor. They wore their visors up, and, riding around
the lists three times, showed themselves to the spectators.
Both were goodly persons, and both had noble countenances.
But there was an air of manly confidence on the
brow of the Scot, a radiancy of hope, which amounted
even to cheerfulness, while, although pride and effort
had recalled much of Conrade's natural courage, there
lowered still on his brow a cloud of ominous despondence.
Even his steed seemed to tread less lightly and blithely
to the trumpet-sound than the noble Arab which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
bestrode by Sir Kenneth; and the <i>spruch-sprecher</i> shook
his head while he observed, that while the challenger
rode around the lists in the course of the sun<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is,
from right to left<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the defender made the same circuit
<i>widder-sins</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is, from left to right<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>which is in most
countries held ominous.</p>

<p>A temporary altar was erected just beneath the gallery
occupied by the Queen, and beside it stood the Hermit
in the dress of his order, as a Carmelite friar. Other
churchmen were also present. To this altar the challenger
and defender were successively brought forward,
conducted by their respective sponsors. Dismounting
before it, each knight avouched the justice of his cause
by a solemn oath on the Evangelists, and prayed that
his success might be according to the truth or falsehood
of what he then swore. They also made oath, that they
came to do battle in knightly guise, and with the usual
weapons, disclaiming the use of spells, charms, or magical
devices, to incline victory to their side. The challenger
pronounced his vow with a firm and manly voice, and a
bold and cheerful countenance. When the ceremony
was finished, the Scottish Knight looked at the gallery,
and bent his head to the earth, as if in honor of those
invisible beauties which were enclosed within; then,
loaded with armor as he was, sprung to the saddle
without the use of the stirrup, and made his courser
carry him in a succession of caracoles to his station at
the eastern extremity of the lists. Conrade also presented
himself before the altar with boldness enough;
but his voice, as he took the oath, sounded hollow, as if
drowned in his helmet. The lips with which he appealed
to Heaven to adjudge victory to the just quarrel, grew
white as they uttered the impious mockery. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
turned to remount his horse, the Grand Master approached
him closer, as if to rectify something about the
sitting of his gorget, and whispered, "Coward and fool!
recall thy senses, and do me this battle bravely; else,
by Heaven, shouldst thou escape him, thou escapest not
<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>The savage tone in which this was whispered, perhaps
completed the confusion of the Marquis's nerves, for he
stumbled as he made to horse; and though he recovered
his feet, sprung to the saddle with his usual agility, and
displayed his address in horsemanship as he assumed his
position opposite to the challenger's, yet the accident
did not escape those who were on the watch for omens,
which might predict the fate of the day.</p>

<p>The priests, after a solemn prayer that God would
show the rightful quarrel, departed from the lists. The
trumpets of the challenger then rung a flourish, and the
herald-at-arms proclaimed at the eastern end of the lists,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Here
stands a good knight, Sir Kenneth of Scotland,
champion for the royal King Richard of England, who
accuseth Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat, of foul treason
and dishonor done to the said King."</p>

<p>When the words Kenneth of Scotland announced the
name and character of the champion, hitherto scarce
generally known, a loud and cheerful acclaim burst from
the followers of King Richard, and hardly, notwithstanding
repeated commands of silence, suffered the reply of
the defendant to be heard. He, of course, avouched his
innocence, and offered his body for battle. The esquires
of the combatants now approached, and delivered to
each his shield and lance, assisting to hang the former
around his neck, that his two hands might remain free,
one for the management of the bridle, the other to direct
the lance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>The shield of the Scot displayed his old bearing, the
leopard, but with the addition of a collar and broken
chain, in allusion to his late captivity. The shield of
the Marquis bore, in reference to his title, a serrated and
rocky mountain. Each shook his lance aloft, as if to
ascertain the weight and toughness of the unwieldy
weapon, and then laid it in the rest. The sponsors,
heralds, and squires, now retired to the barriers, and the
combatants sat opposite to each other, face to face, with
couched lance and closed visor, the human form so completely
enclosed, that they looked more like statues of
molten iron than beings of flesh and blood. The silence
of suspense was now general<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>men breathed thicker, and
their very souls seemed seated in their eyes, while not a
sound was to be heard save the snorting and pawing of
the good steeds, who, sensible of what was about to
happen, were impatient to dash into career. They stood
thus for perhaps three minutes, when at a signal given
by the Soldan, an hundred instruments rent the air with
their brazen clamors, and each champion striking his
horse with the spurs, and slacking the rein, the horses
started into full gallop, and the knights met in mid space
with a shock like a thunderbolt. The victory was not in
doubt<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no, not one moment. Conrade, indeed, showed
himself a practised warrior; for he struck his antagonist
knightly in the midst of his shield, bearing his lance so
straight and true, that it shivered into splinters from the
steel spear-head up to the very gauntlet. The horse of
Sir Kenneth recoiled two or three yards and fell on his
haunches, but the rider easily raised him with hand and
rein. But for Conrade there was no recovery. Sir
Kenneth's lance had pierced through the shield, through
a plated corselet of Milan steel, through a <i>secret</i>, or coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of linked mail, worn beneath the corselet, had wounded
him deep in the bosom, and borne him from his saddle,
leaving the truncheon of the lance fixed in his wound.
The sponsors, heralds, and Saladin himself, descending
from his throne, crowded around the wounded man;
while Sir Kenneth, who had drawn his sword ere yet he
discovered his antagonist was totally helpless, now commanded
him to avow his guilt. The helmet was hastily
unclosed, and the wounded man, gazing wildly on the
skies, replied, "What would you more? God hath
decided justly. I am guilty<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but there are worse traitors
in the camp than I.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>In pity to my soul, let me have a
confessor!"</p>

<p>He revived as he uttered these words.</p>

<p>"The talisman<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the powerful remedy, royal brother,"
said King Richard to Saladin.</p>

<p>"The traitor," answered the Soldan, "is more fit to be
dragged from the lists to the gallows by the heels, than
to profit by its virtues: and some such fate is in his
look," he added, after gazing fixedly upon the wounded
man; "for though his wound may be cured, yet Azrael's
seal is on the wretch's brow."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Richard, "I pray you do for him
what you may, that he may at least have time for confession.
Slay not soul and body! To him one half-hour
of time may be worth more, by ten thousand fold, than
the life of the oldest patriarch."</p>

<p>"My royal brother's wish shall be obeyed," said
Saladin.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Slaves, bear this wounded man to our tent."</p>

<p>"Do not so," said the Templar, who had hitherto
stood gloomily looking on in silence. "The royal Duke
of Austria and myself will not permit this unhappy
Christian prince to be delivered over to the Saracens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that they may try their spells upon him. We are his
sponsors, and demand that he be assigned to our care."</p>

<p>"That is, you refuse the certain means offered to recover
him?" said Richard.</p>

<p>"Not so," said the Grand Master, recollecting himself.
"If the Soldan useth lawful medicines, he may attend
the patient in my tent."</p>

<p>"Do so, I pray thee, good brother," said Richard to
Saladin, "though the permission be ungraciously yielded.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>But
now to a more glorious work. Sound, trumpets<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>shout,
England, in honor of England's champion!"</p>

<p>Drum, clarion, trumpet, and cymbal, rung forth at
once, and the deep and regular shout, which for ages has
been the English acclamation, sounded amidst the shrill
and irregular yells of the Arabs, like the diapason of the
organ amid the howling of a storm. There was silence
at length.</p>

<p>"Brave Knight of the Leopard," resumed C<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>ur de
Lion, "thou hast shown that the Ethiopian <i>may</i> change
his skin and the Leopard his spots, though clerks quote
Scripture for the impossibility. Yet I have more to say
to you when I have conducted you to the presence of
the ladies, the best judges, and best rewarders, of deeds
of chivalry."</p>

<p>The Knight of the Leopard bowed assent.</p>

<p>"And thou, princely Saladin, wilt also attend them.
I promise thee our Queen will not think herself welcome,
if she lacks the opportunity to thank her royal host for
her most princely reception."</p>

<p>Saladin bent his head gracefully, but declined the
invitation.</p>

<p>"I must attend the wounded man," he said. "The
leech leaves not his patient more than the champion the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
lists, even if he be summoned to a bower like those of
Paradise.... At noon," said the Soldan, as he departed,
"I trust ye will all accept a collation under the
black camel-skin tent of a chief of Curdistan."</p>

<p>The same invitation was circulated among the Christians,
comprehending all those of sufficient importance to
be admitted to sit at a feast made for princes.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Richard, "the timbrels announce that
our Queen and her attendants are leaving their gallery;
and see, the turbans sink on the ground, as if struck
down by a destroying angel. All lie prostrate, as if the
glance of an Arab's eye could sully the lustre of a lady's
cheek! Come, we will to the pavillion, and lead our
conqueror thither in triumph. How I pity that noble
Soldan, who knows but of love as it is known to those of
inferior nature!"</p>

<p>Blondel tuned his harp to its boldest measure, to
welcome the introduction of the victor into the pavilion
of Queen Berengaria. He entered, supported on either
side by his sponsors, Richard and William Longsword,
and knelt gracefully down before the Queen, though
more than half the homage was silently rendered to
Edith, who sat on her right hand.</p>

<p>"Unarm him, my mistresses," said the King, whose
delight was in the execution of such chivalrous usages;
"let Beauty honor Chivalry! Undo his spurs, Berengaria;
Queen though thou be, thou owest him what
marks of favor thou canst give.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Unlace his helmet,
Edith; by this hand, thou shalt, wert thou the proudest
Plantagenet of the line, and he the poorest knight on
earth!"</p>

<p>Both ladies obeyed the royal commands,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Berengaria
with bustling assiduity, as anxious to gratify her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>band's
humor, and Edith blushing and growing pale
alternately, as slowly and awkwardly she undid, with
Longsword's assistance, the fastenings which secured the
helmet to the gorget.</p>

<p>"And what expect you from beneath this iron shell?"
said Richard, as the removal of the casque gave to view
the noble countenance of Sir Kenneth, his face glowing
with recent exertion, and not less so with present emotion.
"What think ye of him, gallants and beauties?" said
Richard. "Doth he resemble an Ethiopian slave, or
doth he present the face of an obscure and nameless
adventurer? No, by my good sword! Here terminate
his various disguises. He hath knelt down before you,
unknown save by his worth; he arises, equally distinguished
by birth and by fortune. The adventurous
knight, Kenneth, arises David, Earl of Huntingdon,
Prince Royal of Scotland!"</p>

<p>There was a general exclamation of surprise, and
Edith dropped from her hand the helmet which she had
just received....</p>

<p>"May we know of your grace by what strange and
happy chance this riddle has been read?" said the Queen
Berengaria.</p>

<p>"Letters were brought to us from England," said the
King, "in which we learned, among other unpleasant
news, that the King of Scotland had seized upon three
of our nobles, when on a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian,
and alleged as a cause, that his heir being supposed to
be fighting in the ranks of the Teutonic Knights, against
the heathen of Borussia, was, in fact, in our camp and in
our power; and, therefore, William proposed to hold
these nobles as hostages for his safety. This gave me
the first light on the real rank of the Knight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Leopard, and my suspicions were confirmed by De Vaux,
who, on his return from Ascalon, brought back with him
the Earl of Huntingdon's sole attendant, a thick-skulled
slave, who had gone thirty miles to unfold to De Vaux
a secret he should have told to me."</p>

<p>"Old Strauchan must be excused," said the Lord of
Gilsland. "He knew from experience that my heart is
somewhat softer than if I wrote myself Plantagenet."</p>

<p>"Thy heart soft? thou commodity of old iron, and
Cumberland flint that thou art!" exclaimed the King.
"It is we Plantagenets who boast soft and feeling hearts,
Edith," he continued, turning to his cousin, with an expression
which called the blood into her cheek.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Give
me thy hand, my fair cousin, and, Prince of Scotland,
thine."...</p>

<p>It is needless to follow into further particulars the
conferences at the royal tent, or to enquire whether
David, Earl of Huntingdon, was as mute in the presence
of Edith Plantagenet, as when he was bound to act under
the character of an obscure and nameless adventurer.
It may be well believed that he there expressed, with
suitable earnestness, the passion to which he had so often
before found it difficult to give words.</p>

<p>The hour of noon now approached, and Saladin waited
to receive the Princes of Christendom in a tent, which,
but for its large size, differed little from that of the
ordinary shelter of the common Curdman, or Arab; yet,
beneath its ample and sable covering, was prepared a
banquet after the most gorgeous fashion of the East,
extended upon carpets of the richest stuffs, with cushions
laid for the guests. But we cannot stop to describe the
cloth of gold and silver, the superb embroidery in Arabesque,
the shawls of Cashmere, and the muslins of India,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
which were here unfolded in all their splendor; far less
to tell the different sweetmeats, ragouts edged with rice
colored in various manners, with all the other niceties of
Eastern cookery. Lambs roasted whole, and game and
poultry dressed in pilaus, were piled in vessels of gold,
and silver, and porcelain, and intermixed with large
mazers of sherbet, cooled in snow and ice from the caverns
of Mount Lebanon. A magnificent pile of cushions at
the head of the banquet, seemed prepared for the master
of the feast, and such dignitaries as he might call to
share that place of distinction, while from the roof of the
tent in all quarters, but over this seat of eminence in
particular, waved many a banner and pennon, the trophies
of battles won, and kingdoms overthrown. But amongst
and above them all, a long lance displayed a shroud,
the banner of Death, with this impressive inscription,
"<span class="smcap">Saladin, King of Kings</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><span class="smcap">Saladin, Victor of
Victors</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><span class="smcap">Saladin must die</span>." Amid these preparations,
the slaves who had arranged the refreshments
stood with drooped heads and folded arms, mute and
motionless as monumental statuary, or as automata,
which waited the touch of the artist to put them in
motion.</p>

<p>Expecting the approach of his princely guests, the
Soldan, imbued, as most were, with the superstitions of
his time, paused over a horoscope and corresponding
scroll, which had been sent to him by the Hermit of
Engaddi when he departed from the camp.</p>

<p>"Strange and mysterious science," he muttered to
himself, "which, pretending to draw the curtain of
futurity, misleads those whom it seems to guide, and
darkens the scene which it pretends to illuminate! Who
would not have said that I was that enemy most danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>ous
to Richard, whose enmity was to be ended by
marriage with his kinswoman? Yet it now appears that
a union betwixt this gallant Earl and the lady will bring
about friendship betwixt Richard and Scotland, an enemy
more dangerous than I, as a wild cat in a chamber is
more to be dreaded than a lion in a distant desert.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>But
then,...<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>How now, what means this intrusion?"</p>

<p>He spoke to the dwarf Nectabanus, who rushed into
the tent fearfully agitated, with each strange and disproportioned
feature wrenched by horror into still more
extravagant ugliness,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>his mouth open, his eyes staring,
his hands, with their shrivelled and deformed fingers,
wildly expanded.</p>

<p>"What now?" said the Soldan, sternly.</p>

<p>"<i>Accipe hoc!</i>" groaned out the dwarf.</p>

<p>"Ha! say'st thou?" answered Saladin.</p>

<p>"<i>Accipe hoc!</i>" replied the panic-struck creature, unconscious,
perhaps, that he repeated the same words as
before.</p>

<p>"Hence! I am in no vein for foolery," said the
Emperor.</p>

<p>"Nor am I further fool," said the dwarf, "than to make
my folly help out my wits to earn my bread, poor helpless
wretch!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Hear, hear me, great Soldan!"</p>

<p>"Nay, if thou hast actual wrong to complain of," said
Saladin, "fool or wise, thou art entitled to the ear of a
King.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Retire hither with me;" and he led him into the
inner tent.</p>

<p>Whatever their conference related to, it was soon
broken off by the fanfare of the trumpets, announcing
the arrival of the various Christian princes, whom Saladin
welcomed to his tent with a royal courtesy well becoming
their rank and his own; but chiefly he saluted the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Earl of Huntingdon, and generously congratulated him
upon prospects, which seemed to have interfered with
and overclouded those which he had himself entertained.</p>

<p>"But think not," said the Soldan, "thou noble youth,
that the Prince of Scotland is more welcome to Saladin,
than was Kenneth to the solitary Ilderim when they met
in the desert, or the distressed Ethiop to the Hakim
Adonbec. A brave and generous disposition like thine
hath a value independent of condition and birth, as the
cool draught which I here proffer thee, is as delicious
from an earthen vessel as from a goblet of gold."</p>

<p>The Earl of Huntingdon made a suitable reply, gratefully
acknowledging the various important services he
had received from the generous Soldan; but when he had
pledged Saladin in the bowl of sherbet which the Soldan
had proffered to him, he could not help remarking with
a smile, "The brave cavalier, Ilderim, knew not of the
formation of ice, but the munificent Soldan cools his
sherbet with snow."</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou have an Arab or a Curdman as wise as
a Hakim?" said the Soldan. "He who does on a disguise
must make the sentiments of his heart and the
learning of his head accord with the dress which he
assumes. I desired to see how a brave and single-hearted
cavalier of Frangistan would conduct himself in debate
with such a chief as I then seemed; and I questioned
the truth of a well-known fact, to know by what arguments
thou wouldst support thy assertion."</p>

<p>While they were speaking, the Archduke of Austria,
who stood a little apart, was struck with the mention of
iced sherbet, and took with pleasure and some bluntness
the deep goblet, as the Earl of Huntingdon was about to
replace it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>"Most delicious!" he exclaimed, after a deep draught,
which the heat of the weather, and the feverishness
following the debauch of the preceding day, had rendered
doubly acceptable. He sighed as he handed the cup to
the Grand Master of the Templars. Saladin made a
sign to the dwarf, who advanced and pronounced, with
a harsh voice, the words, <i>Accipe hoc!</i> The Templar
started, like a steed who sees a lion under a bush, beside
the pathway; yet instantly recovered, and to hide, perhaps,
his confusion, raised the goblet to his lips;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but
those lips never touched that goblet's rim. The sabre of
Saladin left its sheath as lightning leaves the cloud. It
was waved in the air,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and the head of the Grand Master
rolled to the extremity of the tent, while the trunk remained,
for a second, standing, with the goblet still
clenched in its grasp, then fell, the liquor mingling with
the blood that spurted from the veins.</p>

<p>There was a general exclamation of treason, and
Austria, nearest to whom Saladin stood with the bloody
sabre in his hand, started back as if apprehensive that
his turn was to come next. Richard and others laid
hand on their swords.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, noble Austria," said Saladin, as composedly
as if nothing had happened, "nor you, royal
England, be wroth at what you have seen. Not for his
manifold treasons;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not for the attempt which, as may
be vouched by his own squire, he instigated against King
Richard's life;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not that he pursued the Prince of Scotland
and myself in the desert, reducing us to save our
lives by the speed of our horses;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not that he had
stirred up the Maronites to attack us upon this very
occasion, had I not brought up unexpectedly so many
Arabs as rendered the scheme abortive;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not for any or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
all of these crimes does he now lie there, although each
were deserving such a doom;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but because, scarce half-an-hour
ere he polluted our presence, as the simoom
empoisons the atmosphere, he poniarded his comrade
and accomplice, Conrade of Montserrat, lest he should
confess the infamous plots in which they had both been
engaged."</p>

<p>"How! Conrade murdered?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>And by the Grand
Master, his sponsor and most intimate friend!" exclaimed
Richard. "Noble Soldan, I would not doubt thee; yet
this must be proved; otherwise"<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins></p>

<p>"There stands the evidence," said Saladin, pointing to
the terrified dwarf. "Allah, who sends the fire-fly to
illuminate the night-season, can discover secret crimes
by the most contemptible means."</p>

<p>The Soldan proceeded to tell the dwarf's story, which
amounted to this.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>In his foolish curiosity, or as he
partly confessed, with some thoughts of pilfering, Nectabanus
had strayed into the tent of Conrade, which had
been deserted by his attendants, some of whom had left
the encampment to carry the news of his defeat to his
brother, and others were availing themselves of the means
which Saladin had supplied for revelling. The wounded
man slept under the influence of Saladin's wonderful
talisman, so that the dwarf had opportunity to pry about
at pleasure, until he was frightened into concealment by
the sound of a heavy step. He skulked behind a curtain,
yet could see the motions, and hear the words of the Grand
Master, who entered, and carefully secured the covering
of the pavillion behind him. His victim started from
sleep, and it would appear that he instantly suspected
the purpose of his old associate, for it was in a tone of
alarm that he demanded wherefore he disturbed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>"I come to confess and absolve thee," answered the
Grand Master.</p>

<p>Of their further speech the terrified dwarf remembered
little, save that Conrade implored the Grand Master not
to break a wounded reed, and that the Templar struck
him to the heart with a Turkish dagger, with the words
<i>Accipe hoc</i>,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>words which long afterward haunted the
terrified imagination of the concealed witness.</p>

<p>"I verified the tale," said Saladin, "by causing the
body to be examined; and I made this unhappy being,
whom Allah hath made the discoverer of the crime,
repeat in your own presence the words which the murderer
spoke, and you yourselves saw the effect which
they produced upon his conscience."</p>

<p>The Soldan paused, and the King of England broke
silence:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p>"If this be true, as I doubt not, we have witnessed a
great act of justice, though it bore a different aspect.
But wherefore in this presence? wherefore with thine
own hand?"</p>

<p>"I had designed otherwise," said Saladin, "but had I
not hastened his doom, it had been altogether averted,
since, if I had permitted him to taste of my cup, as he
was about to do, how could I, without incurring the
brand of inhospitality, have done him to death as he
deserved? Had he murdered my father, and afterward
partaken of my food and my bowl, not a hair of his head
could have been injured by me. But enough of him; let
his carcass and his memory be removed from amongst
us."</p>

<p>The body was carried away, and the marks of the
slaughter obliterated or concealed with such ready dexterity,
as showed that the case was not altogether so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
uncommon, as to paralyze the assistants and officers of
Saladin's household.</p>

<p>But the Christian princes felt that the scene which
they had beheld weighed heavily on their spirits, and
although, at the courteous invitation of the Soldan, they
assumed their seats at the banquet, yet it was with the
silence of doubt and amazement. The spirits of Richard
alone surmounted all cause for suspicion or embarrassment.
Yet he, too, seemed to ruminate on some proposition,
as if he were desirous of making it in the most
insinuating and acceptable manner which was possible.
At length he drank off a large bowl of wine, and
addressing the Soldan, desired to know whether it was
not true that he had honored the Earl of Huntingdon
with a personal encounter.</p>

<p>Saladin answered with a smile, that he had proved his
horse and his weapons with the heir of Scotland, as
cavaliers are wont to do with each other when they meet
in the desert; and modestly added that, though the
combat was not entirely decisive, he had not, on his
part, much reason to pride himself on the event. The
Scot, on the other hand, disclaimed the attributed
superiority, and wished to assign it to the Soldan.</p>

<p>"Enough of honor thou hast had in the encounter,"
said Richard, "and I envy thee more for that, than for
the smiles of Edith Plantagenet, though one of them
might reward a bloody day's work.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>But what say you,
noble princes; is it fitting that such a royal ring of
chivalry should break up without something being done
for future times to speak of? What is the overthrow
and death of a traitor, to such a fair garland of honor as
is here assembled, and which ought not to part without
witnessing something more worthy of their regard?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
How say you, princely Soldan; what if we two should
now, and before this fair company, decide the long-contended
question for this land of Palestine, and end at
once these tedious wars? Yonder are the lists ready,
nor can Paynimrie ever hope a better champion than
thou. I, unless worthier offers, will lay down my gauntlet
in behalf of Christendom, and, in all love and honor,
we will do mortal battle for the possession of Jerusalem."</p>

<p>There was a deep pause for the Soldan's answer. His
cheek and brow colored highly, and it was the opinion
of many present that he hesitated whether he should
accept the challenge. At length he said: "Fighting for
the Holy City against those whom we regard as idolaters,
and worshippers of stocks and stones, and graven images,
I might confide that Allah would strengthen my arm; or
if I fell beneath the sword of the Melech Ric, I could not
pass to Paradise by a more glorious death. But Allah
has already given Jerusalem to the true believers, and it
were a tempting the God of the Prophet to peril, upon
my own personal strength and skill, that which I hold
securely by the superiority of my forces."</p>

<p>"If not for Jerusalem, then," said Richard, in the tone
of one who would entreat a favor of an intimate friend,
"yet, for the love of honor, let us run at least three courses
with grinded lances."</p>

<p>"Even this," said Saladin, half smiling at C<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>ur de
Lion's affectionate earnestness for the combat, "even this
I may not lawfully do. The Master places the shepherd
over the flock, not for the shepherd's own sake, but for
the sake of the sheep. Had I a son to hold the sceptre
when I fell, I might have had the liberty, as I have the
will, to brave this bold encounter; but your own Scripture
sayeth, that when the herdsman is smitten, the sheep are
scattered."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>"Thou hast had all the fortune," said Richard, turning
to the Earl of Huntingdon with a sigh. "I would have
given the best year of my life for that one half-hour
beside the Diamond of the Desert!"</p>

<p>The chivalrous extravagance of Richard awakened the
spirits of the assembly, and when at length they arose to
depart, Saladin advanced and took C<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>ur de Lion by the
hand.</p>

<p>"Noble King of England," he said, "we now part, never
to meet again. That your league is dissolved, no more
to be reunited, and that your native forces are far too
few to enable you to prosecute your enterprise, is as well
known to me as to yourself. I may not yield you up
that Jerusalem which you so much desire to hold. It is
to us, as to you, a Holy City. But whatever other terms
Richard demands of Saladin, shall be as willingly yielded
as yonder fountain yields its waters. Ay, and the same
should be as frankly afforded by Saladin, if Richard stood
in the desert with but two archers in his train!"<br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I_46" id="Footnote_I_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_46"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> While the army of the crusaders was inactive near Ascalon, a truce having
been agreed to between the Saracens and their assailants, the Grand Master of
the Templars, Conrade Marquis of Montserrat, and others of the Christian
Princes, were plotting to effect its dismemberment. Richard of England was
the leading spirit of the crusade, and the plotters wished either to get rid of
him or to inspire his colleagues with jealousy of his leadership. The Grand
Master sought to have the King assassinated. Conrade tried to break up the
league by milder means: he first provoked the Duke of Austria to insult the
English banner; and then thinking rightly that the suspicion and wrath of
Richard would fall upon Austria, he secretly stole the banner from its place.
Its safe-keeping, after Austria's insult, had been entrusted by the King to Sir
Kenneth, known as the Knight of the Leopard, in reality David Prince of
Scotland, who in the disguise of an obscure gentleman had joined the crusade
as a follower of the English King. Sir Kenneth was innocently decoyed from
his watch, and in his absence, the banner, left with but his dog to guard it, was
stolen by Conrade. For his failure of duty. Sir Kenneth was condemned to
immediate death, but Saladin, who in the disguise of an Arab physician was in
the English camp, and who had rescued the King from death by fever, urgently
interceding, his life was spared. Saladin took Sir Kenneth to the camp of the
Saracens, and knowing his worth and valor, having previously had knightly
encounter with him in the desert, disguised him as a Nubian slave, and sent
him as a present to Richard with the hope that he might in some way discover
by whom the banner had been stolen. Attending Richard as a slave Sir Kenneth
saved the king from the assassination which the Grand Master had instigated,
and aided by the instinct of his dog, also disguised, he detected the thief
in Conrade. Richard thereupon, at once charged Conrade with the theft, and
challenged him to mortal combat. The King was prevented by the Council of
the Princes from fighting in person, but having divined in the Nubian slave the
former Knight of the Leopard, he permitted Sir Kenneth to fight in his stead,
that the knight might atone for the dishonor of being faithless in his watch.
Conrade's cause was espoused by the Grand Master, who had been his confidant,
and by the Duke of Austria. The encounter was appointed to take place at the
Diamond of the Desert, in the territory of Saladin, who was asked to act as
umpire. It had been stipulated that but five hundred Saracens should be present
at the trial; Saladin, however, having been apprised of further plotting on the
part of the Grand Master, for safety's sake caused a larger attendance of his followers.
Sir Kenneth had long loved Edith Plantagenet, but being known to her
only as a poor and nameless adventurer, he had not yet openly avowed his love.</p></div>

<div class="block" style="width: 370px;">
<p><span class="smcap">Sweet</span> Highland girl, a very shower<br />
Of beauty is thy earthly dower!<br />
Twice seven consenting years have shed<br />
Their utmost bounty on thy head:<br />
And these gray rocks; this household lawn;<br />
These trees, a veil just half withdrawn;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
This fall of water, that doth make<br />
A murmur near the silent lake;<br />
This little bay, a quiet road<br />
That holds in shelter thy abode;<br />
In truth, together do ye seem<br />
Like something fashion'd in a dream;<br />
Such forms as from their covert peep<br />
When earthly cares are laid asleep!<br />
Yet, dream and vision as thou art,<br />
I bless thee with a human heart:<br />
God shield thee to thy latest years!<br />
Thee neither know I nor thy peers;<br />
And yet my eyes are fill'd with tears.</p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 1em;">With earnest feeling I shall pray</span><br />
For thee when I am far away:<br />
For never saw I mien, or face,<br />
In which more plainly I could trace<br />
Benignity and home-bred sense<br />
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br />
Here scatter'd like a random seed,<br />
Remote from men, thou dost not need<br />
The embarrass'd look of shy distress,<br />
And maidenly shamefac<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>dness:<br />
Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear<br />
The freedom of a mountaineer:<br />
A face with gladness overspread!<br />
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!<br />
And seemliness complete, that sways<br />
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;<br />
With no restraint, but such as springs<br />
From quick and eager visitings<br />
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br />
Of thy few words of English speech:<br />
A bondage sweetly brook'd, a strife<br />
That gives thy gestures grace and life!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>So have I, not unmov'd in mind,<br />
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind,<br />
Thus beating up against the wind.</p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 2em;">What hand but would a garland cull</span><br />
For thee who art so beautiful?<br />
O happy pleasure! here to dwell<br />
Beside thee in some heathy dell;<br />
Adopt your homely ways, and dress,<br />
A shepherd, thou a shepherdess!<br />
But I could frame a wish for thee<br />
More like a grave reality:<br />
Thou art to me but as a wave<br />
Of the wild sea; and I would have<br />
Some claim upon thee, if I could,<br />
Though but of common neighborhood.<br />
What joy to hear thee, and to see!<br />
Thy elder brother I would be,<br />
Thy father, anything to thee!</p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 2em;">Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace</span><br />
Hath led me to this lonely place.<br />
Joy have I had; and going hence<br />
I bear away my recompense.<br />
In spots like these it is we prize<br />
Our memory, feel that she hath eyes:<br />
Then, why should I be loth to stir?<br />
I feel this place was made for her;<br />
To give new pleasure like the past,<br />
Continued long as life shall last.<br />
Nor am I loth, though pleas'd at heart,<br />
Sweet Highland girl! from thee to part;<br />
For I, methinks, till I grow old,<br />
As fair before me shall behold,<br />
As I do now, the cabin small,<br />
The lake, the bay, the waterfall;<br />
And thee, the spirit of them all!</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 550px;">
<p><span class="smcap">King Francis</span> was a hearty king, and lov'd a royal sport,<br />
And one day, as his lions strove, sat looking on the court:<br />
The nobles fill'd the benches round, the ladies by their side,<br />
And 'mongst them Count de Lorge, with one he hoped to make<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">his bride;</span><br />
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,<br />
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.</p>

<p>Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;<br />
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">their paws;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
With wallowing might and stifled roar they roll'd one on another,<br />
Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thund'rous smother;<br />
The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air;<br />
Said Francis then, "Good gentlemen, we're better here than<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">there!"</span></p>

<p>De Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous, lively dame,<br />
With smiling lips, and sharp bright eyes, which always seem'd<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the same:</span><br />
She thought, "The Count, my lover, is as brave as brave can be;<br />
He surely would do desperate things to show his love of me!<br />
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the chance is wondrous fine;<br />
I'll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine!"</p>

<p>She dropp'd her glove to prove his love: then look'd on him<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and smiled;</span><br />
He bow'd, and in a moment leap'd among the lions wild:<br />
The leap was quick; return was quick; he soon regain'd his<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">place;</span><br />
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face!<br />
"In truth!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">where he sat:</span><br />
"No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that!"</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> this view of the imperial character and relations
must be added one single circumstance, which in some
measure altered the whole for the individual who happened
to fill the office. The emperor <i>de facto</i> might be
viewed under two aspects; there was the man, and there
was the office. In his office he was immortal and sacred:
but as a question might still be raised, by means of a
mercenary army, as to the claims of the particular individual
who at any time filled the office, the very sanctity
and privilege of the character with which he was clothed
might actually be turned against himself; and here it is,
at this point, that the character of Roman emperor became
truly and mysteriously awful. Gibbon has taken
notice of the extraordinary situation of a <i>subject</i> in the
Roman empire who should attempt to fly from the wrath
of the C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar. Such was the ubiquity of the emperor
that this was metaphysically hopeless. Except across
pathless deserts or amongst barbarous nomads, it was
impossible to find even a transient sanctuary from the
imperial pursuit. If the fugitive went down to the sea,
there he met the emperor: if he took the wings of the
morning, and fled to the uttermost parts of the earth,
there was also C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar in the person of his lieutenants.
But, by a dreadful counter-charm, the same omnipresence
of imperial anger and retribution which withered the
hopes of the poor humble prisoner, met and confounded
the emperor himself, when hurled from his elevation by
some fortunate rival. All the kingdoms of the earth, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
one in that situation, became but so many wards of the
same infinite prison. Flight, if it were even successful
for the moment, did but a little retard his inevitable
doom. And so evident was this, that hardly in one
instance did the fallen prince <i>attempt</i> to fly; passively he
met the death which was inevitable, in the very spot
where ruin had overtaken him. Neither was it possible
even for a merciful conqueror to show mercy; for, in the
presence of an army so mercenary and factious, his own
safety was but too deeply involved in the extermination
of rival pretenders to the crown.</p>

<p>Such, amidst the sacred security and inviolability of
the office, was the hazardous tenure of the individual.
Nor did his dangers always arise from persons in the
rank of competitors and rivals. Sometimes it menaced
him in quarters which his eye had never penetrated, and
from enemies too obscure to have reached his ear. By
way of illustration we will cite a case from the life of the
Emperor Commodus, which is wild enough to have
furnished the plot of a romance, though as well authenticated
as any other passage in that reign. The story is
narrated by Herodian, and the outline was this:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>A
slave of noble qualities, and of magnificent person, having
liberated himself from the degradations of bondage, determined
to avenge his own wrongs by inflicting continual
terror upon the town and neighborhood which had witnessed
his humiliation. For this purpose he resorted to
the woody recesses of the province (somewhere in the
modern Transylvania), and, attracting to his wild encampment
as many fugitives as he could, by degrees he
succeeded in training a very formidable troop of freebooters.
Partly from the energy of his own nature, and
partly from the neglect and remissness of the provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
magistrates, the robber captain rose from less to more,
until he had formed a little army, equal to the task of
assaulting fortified cities. In this stage of his adventures
he encountered and defeated several of the imperial
officers commanding large detachments of troops; and
at length grew of consequence sufficient to draw upon
himself the emperor's eye, and the honor of his personal
displeasure. In high wrath and disdain at the insults
offered to his eagles by this fugitive slave, Commodus
fulminated against him such an edict as left him no hope
of much longer escaping with impunity.</p>

<p>Public vengeance was now awakened; the imperial
troops were marching from every quarter upon the same
centre; and the slave became sensible that in a very
short space of time he must be surrounded and destroyed.
In this desperate situation he took a desperate resolution:
he assembled his troops, laid before them his plan, concerted
the various steps for carrying it into effect, and
then dismissed them as independent wanderers. So ends
the first chapter of the tale.</p>

<p>The next opens in the passes of the Alps, whither, by
various routes, of seven or eight hundred miles in extent,
these men had threaded their way in manifold disguises,
through the very midst of the emperor's camps. According
to this man's gigantic enterprise, in which the means
were as audacious as the purpose, the conspirators were
to rendezvous, and first to recognize each other, at the
gates of Rome. From the Danube to the Tiber did this
band of robbers severally pursue their perilous routes
through all the difficulties of the road and the jealousies
of the military stations, sustained by the mere thirst of
vengeance<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>vengeance against that mighty foe whom
they knew only by his proclamations against themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Everything continued to prosper; the conspirators met
under the walls of Rome; the final details were arranged;
and those also would have prospered but for a trifling
accident. The season was one of general carnival at
Rome; and, by the help of those disguises which the
license of this festival time allowed, the murderers were
to have penetrated as maskers to the emperor's retirement,
when a casual word or two awoke the suspicions
of a sentinel. One of the conspirators was arrested;
under the terror and uncertainty of the moment, he made
much ampler discoveries than were expected of him;
the other accomplices were secured: and Commodus was
delivered from the uplifted daggers of those who had
sought him by months of patient wanderings, pursued
through all the depths of the Illyrian forests, and the
difficulties of the Alpine passes. It is not easy to find
words of admiration commensurate to the energetic
hardihood of a slave<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who, by way of answer and reprisal
to an edict summarily consigning him to persecution and
death, determines to cross Europe in quest of its author,
though no less a person than the master of the world<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>to
seek him out in the inmost recesses of his capital city,
of his private palace, of his consecrated bed-chamber<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
there to lodge a dagger in his heart, as the adequate
reply to the imperial sentence of proscription against
himself.</p>

<p>Such, amidst the superhuman grandeur and hallowed
privileges of the Roman emperor's office, were the extraordinary
perils which menaced the individual officer.
The office rose by its grandeur to a region above the
clouds and vapors of earth: the officer might find his
personal security as unsubstantial as those wandering
vapors. Nor is it possible that these circumstances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
violent opposition can be better illustrated than in this
tale of Herodian. Whilst the emperor's mighty arms
were stretched out to arrest some potentate in the heart
of Asia, a poor slave is silently and stealthily creeping
round the base of the Alps, with the purpose of winning
his way as a murderer to the imperial bed-chamber;
C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar is watching some potent rebel of the Orient, at a
distance of two thousand leagues, and he overlooks the
dagger which is within three stealthy steps, and one
tiger's leap, of his own heart. All the heights and the
depths which belong to man's frailty, all the contrasts of
glory and meanness, the extremities of what is highest
and lowest in human casualties, meeting in the station of
the Roman C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar Semper Augustus<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>have combined to
call him into high marble relief, and to make him the
most interesting study of all whom history has emblazoned
with colors of fire and blood, or has crowned
most lavishly with diadems of cyprus and laurel.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> state of spiritual folly is, I suppose, one of the
most universal evils in the world. For the number of
those who are naturally foolish is exceedingly great; of
those, I mean, who understand no worldly thing well; of
those who are careless about everything, carried about
by every breath of opinion, without knowledge, and
without principle. But the term spiritual folly includes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
unhappily, a great many more than these; it takes in
not those only who are in the common sense of the term
foolish, but a great many who are in the common sense
of the term clever, and many who are even in the common
sense of the terms, prudent, sensible, thoughtful, and
wise. It is but too evident that some of the ablest men
who have ever lived upon earth, have been in no less a
degree spiritually fools. And thus, it is not without
much truth that Christian writers have dwelt upon the
insufficiency of worldly wisdom, and have warned their
readers to beware, lest, while professing themselves to be
wise, they should be accounted as fools in the sight of
God.</p>

<p>But the opposite to this notion, that those who are, as
it were, fools in worldly matters are wise before God,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>although
this also is true in a certain sense, and under
certain peculiar circumstances, yet taken generally, it is
the very reverse of truth; and the careless and incautious
language which has been often used on this subject, has
been extremely mischievous. On the contrary, he who
is foolish in worldly matters is likely also to be, and
most commonly is, no less foolish in the things of God.
And the opposite belief has arisen mainly from that
strange confusion between ignorance and innocence, with
which many ignorant persons seem to solace themselves.
Whereas, if you take away a man's knowledge, you do
not bring him to the state of an infant, but to that of a
brute; and of one of the most mischievous and malignant
of the brute creation. For you do not lessen or weaken
the man's body by lowering his mind; he still retains
his strength and his passions, the passions leading to
self-indulgence, the strength which enables him to feed
them by continued gratification. He will not think, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
true, to any good purpose; it is very possible to destroy
in him the power of reflection, whether as exercised upon
outward things, or upon himself and his own nature, or
upon God. But you cannot destroy the power of adapting
means to ends, nor that of concealing his purposes
by fraud or falsehood; you take only his wisdom, and
leave that cunning which marks so notoriously both the
savage and the madman. He, then, who is a fool as far
as regards earthly things, is much more a fool with
regard to heavenly things; he who cannot raise himself
even to the lower height, how is he to attain to the
higher? he who is without reason and conscience, how
shall he be endowed with the spirit of God?</p>

<p>It is my deep conviction and long experience of this
truth, which makes me so grieve over a want of interest
in your own improvement in human learning, whenever
I observe it,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>over the prevalence of a thoughtless and
childish spirit amongst you.... The idleness and want
of interest which I grieve for, is one which extends itself,
but too impartially, to knowledge of every kind: to
divine knowledge, as might be expected, even more than
to human. Those whom we commonly find careless
about their general lessons, are quite as ignorant and as
careless about their Bibles; those who have no interest in
general literature, in poetry, or in history, or in philosophy,
have certainly no greater interest, I do not say in works
of theology, but in works of practical devotion, in the
lives of holy men, in meditations, or in prayers. Alas,
the interest of their minds is bestowed on things far
lower than the very lowest of all which I have named;
and therefore, to see them desiring something only a
little higher than their present pursuits, could not but be
encouraging; it would, at least, show that the mind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
rising upwards. It may, indeed, stop at a point short of
the highest, it may learn to love earthly excellence, and
rest there contented, and seek for nothing more perfect;
but that, at any rate, is a future and merely contingent
evil. It is better to love earthly excellence than earthly
folly; it is far better in itself, and it is, by many degrees,
nearer to the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>There is another case, however, which I cannot but
think is more frequent now than formerly; and if it is
so, it may be worth while to direct our attention to
it. Common idleness and absolute ignorance are not
what I wish to speak of now, but a character advanced
above these; a character which does not neglect its
school-lessons, but really attains to considerable proficiency
in them; a character at once regular and amiable,
abstaining from evil, and for evil in its low and grosser
forms having a real abhorrence. What, then, you will
say, is wanting here? I will tell you what seems to be
wanting<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a spirit of manly, and much more of Christian,
thoughtfulness. There is quickness and cleverness;
much pleasure, perhaps, in distinction, but little in improvement;
there is no desire of knowledge for its own
sake, whether human or divine. There is, therefore, but
little power of combining and digesting what is read;
and, consequently, what is read passes away, and takes
no root in the mind. This same character shows itself
in matters of conduct; it will adopt, without scruple, the
most foolish, commonplace notions of boys, about what
is right and wrong; it will not, and cannot, from the
lightness of its mind, concern itself seriously about what
is evil in the conduct of others, because it takes no
regular care of its own, with reference to pleasing God;
it will not do anything low or wicked, but it will some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>times
laugh at those who do; and it will by no means
take pains to encourage, nay, it will sometimes thwart
and oppose anything that breathes a higher spirit, and
asserts a more manly and Christian standard of duty.</p>

<p>One cause of this consists in the number and character
and cheapness, and peculiar mode of publication, of the
works of amusement of the present day. The works of
amusement published only a very few years since were
comparatively few in number; they were less exciting,
and therefore less attractive; they were dearer, and
therefore less accessible; and, not being published
periodically, they did not occupy the mind for so long a
time, nor keep alive so constant an expectation; nor, by
thus dwelling upon the mind, and distilling themselves
into it as it were drop by drop, did they possess it so
largely, coloring even, in many instances, its very language,
and affording frequent matter for conversation.</p>

<p>The evil of all these circumstances is actually enormous.
The mass of human minds, and much more of the minds
of young persons, have no great appetite for intellectual
exercise; but they have some, which by careful treatment
may be strengthened and increased. But here to
this weak and delicate appetite is presented an abundance
of the most stimulating and least nourishing food
possible. It snatches it greedily, and is not only satisfied,
but actually conceives a distaste for anything simpler and
more wholesome. That curiosity which is wisely given
us to lead us on to knowledge, finds its full gratification
in the details of an exciting and protracted story, and
then lies down as it were gorged, and goes to sleep.
Other faculties claim their turn, and have it. We know
that in youth the healthy body and lively spirits require
exercise, and in this they may and ought to be indulged;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
but the time and interest which remain over when the
body has had its enjoyment, and the mind desires its
share, this has been already wasted and exhausted upon
things utterly unprofitable: so that the mind goes to its
work hurriedly and languidly, and feels it to be no more
than a burden. The mere lessons may be learnt from a
sense of duty; but that freshness of power which in
young persons of ability would fasten eagerly upon some
one portion or other of the wide field of knowledge, and
there expatiate, drinking in health and strength to the
mind, as surely as the natural exercise of the body gives
to it bodily vigor,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that is tired prematurely, perverted,
and corrupted; and all the knowledge which else it
might so covet, it now seems a wearying effort to retain.</p>

<p>Great and grievous as is the evil, it is peculiarly hard
to find the remedy for it. If the books to which I have
been alluding were books of downright wickedness, we
might destroy them wherever we found them; we might
forbid their open circulation; we might conjure you to
shun them as you would any other clear sin, whether of
word or deed. But they are not wicked books for the
most part; they are of that class which cannot be
actually prohibited; nor can it be pretended that there
is a sin in reading them. They are not the more wicked
for being published so cheap, and at regular intervals;
but yet these two circumstances make them so peculiarly
injurious. All that can be done is to point out the
evil; that it is real and serious I am very sure, and its
defects are most deplorable on the minds of the fairest
promise; but the remedy for it rests with yourselves, or
rather with each of you individually, so far as he is himself
concerned. That an unnatural and constant excitement
of the mind is most injurious, there is no doubt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that excitement involves a consequent weakness, is a law
of our nature than which none is surer; that the weakness
of mind thus produced is and must be adverse to quiet
study and thought, to that reflection which alone is
wisdom, is also clear in itself, and proved too largely by
experience. And that without reflection there can be no
spiritual understanding, is at once evident; while without
spiritual understanding, that is, without a knowledge and
a study of God's will, there can be no spiritual life. And
therefore childishness and unthoughtfulness cannot be
light evils; and if I have rightly traced the prevalence
of these defects to its cause, although that cause may
seem to some to be trifling, yet surely it is well to call
your attention to it, and to remind you that in reading
works of amusement, as in every other lawful pleasure,
there is and must be an abiding responsibility in the
sight of God; that, like other lawful pleasures, we must
beware of excess in it; and not only so, but if we find
it hurtful to us, either because we have used it too freely
in times past, or because our nature is too weak to bear
it, that then we are bound most solemnly to abstain
from it; because, however lawful in itself, or to others
who can practise it without injury, whatever is to us an
hindrance in the way of our intellectual and moral and
spiritual improvement, that is in our case a positive sin.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Doctor Sobersides, the minister of Pumpkinville,
where I lived in my youth, was one of the metaphysical
divines of the old school, and could cavil upon the ninth
part of a hair about entities and quiddities, nominalism
and realism, free-will and necessity, with which sort of
learning he used to stuff his sermons and astound his
learned hearers, the bumpkins. They never doubted
that it was all true, but were apt to say with the old
woman in Moli<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>re: "He speaks so well that I don't
understand him a bit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>I remember a conversation that happened at my
grandfather's, in which the Doctor had some difficulty in
making his metaphysics all "as clear as preaching."
There was my grandfather; Uncle Tim, who was the
greatest hand at raising onions in our part of the country,
but "not knowing metaphysics, had no notion of the true
reason of his not being sad"; my Aunt Judy Keturah
Titterwell, who could knit stockings "like all possest,"
but could not syllogise; Malachi Muggs, our hired man
that drove the oxen; and Isaac Thrasher, the district
schoolmaster, who had dropped in to warm his fingers
and get a drink of cider. Something was under discussion,
and my grandfather could make nothing of it; but
the Doctor said it was "metaphysically true."</p>

<p>"Pray, Doctor," said Uncle Tim, "tell me something
about metaphysics; I have often heard of that science,
but never for my life could find out what it was."</p>

<p>"Metaphysics," said the Doctor, "is the science of abstraction."</p>

<p>"I'm no wiser for that explanation," said Uncle Tim.</p>

<p>"It treats," said the Doctor, "of matters most profound
and sublime, a little difficult perhaps for a common intellect
or an unschooled capacity to fathom, but not the
less important on that account, to all living beings."</p>

<p>"What does it teach?" asked the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"It is not applied so much to the operation of teaching,"
answered the Doctor, "as to that of inquiring; and
the chief inquiry is, whether things are, or whether they
are not."</p>

<p>"I don't understand the question," said Uncle Tim,
taking the pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"For example, whether this earth on which we tread,"
said the Doctor, giving a heavy stamp on the floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
setting his foot on the cat's tail, "whether the earth does
really exist, or whether it does not exist."</p>

<p>"That is a point of considerable consequence to settle,"
said my grandfather.</p>

<p>"Especially," added the schoolmaster, "to the holders
of real estate."</p>

<p>"Now the earth," continued the Doctor, "may exist<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"</p>

<p>"Why, who ever doubted that?" asked Uncle Tim.</p>

<p>"A great many men," said the Doctor, "and some
very learned ones."</p>

<p>Uncle Tim stared a moment, and then began to fill
his pipe, whistling the tune of "Heigh! Betty Martin,"
while the Doctor went on:</p>

<p>"The earth, I say, may exist, although Bishop Berkeley
has proved beyond all possible gainsaying or denial, that
it does not exist. The case is clear; the only difficulty
is, to know whether we shall believe it or not."</p>

<p>"And how," asked Uncle Tim, "is all this to be found
out?"</p>

<p>"By digging down to the first principles," answered
the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Ay," interrupted Malachi, "there is nothing equal to
the spade and pickaxe."</p>

<p>"That is true," said my grandfather, going on in
Malachi's way, "'tis by digging for the foundation, that
we shall find out whether the world exists or not; for, if
we dig to the bottom of the earth and find the foundation<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>why
then we are sure of it. But if we find no foundation,
it is clear that the world stands upon nothing, or, in
other words, that it does not stand at all; therefore, it
stands to reason<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," interrupted the Doctor, "but
you totally mistake me; I used the word digging meta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>phorically,
meaning the profoundest cogitation and research
into the nature of things. That is the way in
which we may ascertain whether things are, or whether
they are not."</p>

<p>"But if a man can't believe his eyes," said Uncle Tim,
"what signifies talking about it?"</p>

<p>"Our eyes," said the Doctor, "are nothing at all but
the inlets of sensation, and when we see a thing, all we
are aware of is, that we have a sensation of it: we are
not aware that the thing exists. We are sure of nothing
that we see with our eyes."</p>

<p>"Not without spectacles," said Aunt Judy.</p>

<p>"Plato, for instance, maintains that the sensation of
any object is produced by a perpetual succession of
copies, images, or counterfeits, streaming off from the
object to the organ of sensation. Descartes, too, has
explained the matter upon the principle of whirligigs."</p>

<p>"But does the world exist?" asked the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"A good deal may be said on both sides," replied the
Doctor, "though the ablest heads are for non-existence."</p>

<p>"In common cases," said Uncle Tim, "those who utter
nonsense are considered blockheads."</p>

<p>"But in metaphysics," said the Doctor, "the case is
different."</p>

<p>"Now all this is hocus-pocus to me," said Aunt Judy,
suspending her knitting-work, and scratching her forehead
with one of the needles, "I don't understand a bit more
of the business than I did at first."</p>

<p>"I'll be bound there is many a learned professor," said
Uncle Tim, "could say the same after spinning a long
yarn of metaphysics."</p>

<p>The Doctor did not admire this gibe at his favorite
science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>"That is as the case may be," said he; "this thing or
that thing may be dubious, but what then? Doubt is
the beginning of wisdom."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that," said my grandfather, beginning to
poke the fire, "and when a man has got through his
doubting, what does he begin to build up in the metaphysical
way?"</p>

<p>"Why, he begins by taking something for granted,"
said the Doctor.</p>

<p>"But is that a sure way of going to work?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the only thing he can do," replied the Doctor,
after a pause, and rubbing his forehead as if he was not
altogether satisfied that his foundation was a solid one.
My grandfather might have posed him with another
question, but he poked the fire and let him go on.</p>

<p>"Metaphysics, to speak exactly<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>"</p>

<p>"Ah," interrupted the Schoolmaster, "bring it down to
vulgar fractions, and then we shall understand it."</p>

<p>"'Tis the consideration of immateriality, or the mere
spirit and essence of things."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Aunt Judy, taking a pinch of
snuff, "now I see into it."</p>

<p>"Thus, man is considered, not in his corporeality, but
in his essence or capability of being; for a man, metaphysically,
or to metaphysical purposes, hath two natures,
that of spirituality, and that of corporeality, which may
be considered separate."</p>

<p>"What man?" asked Uncle Tim.</p>

<p>"Why, any man; Malachi there, for example; I may
consider him as Malachi spiritual, or Malachi corporeal."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Malachi, "for when I was in the
militia they made me a sixteenth corporal, and I carried
grog to the drummer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>"That is another affair," said the Doctor in continuation;
"we speak of man in his essence; we speak, also,
of the essence of locality, the essence of duration<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"</p>

<p>"And essence of peppermint," said Aunt Judy.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the Doctor, "the essence I mean is quite
a different essence."</p>

<p>"Something too fine to be dribbled through the worm
of a still," said my grandfather.</p>

<p>"Then I am all in the dark again," rejoined Aunt
Judy.</p>

<p>"By the spirit and essence of things I mean things in
the abstract."</p>

<p>"And what becomes of a thing when it goes into the
abstract?" asked Uncle Tim.</p>

<p>"Why, it becomes an abstraction."</p>

<p>"There we are again," said Uncle Tim; "but what on
earth is an abstraction?"</p>

<p>"It is a thing that has no matter: that is, it cannot be
felt, seen, heard, smelt, or tasted; it has no substance or
solidity; it is neither large nor small, hot nor cold, long
nor short."</p>

<p>"Then what is the long and short of it?" asked the
Schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Abstraction," replied the Doctor.</p>

<p>"Suppose, for instance," said Malachi, "that I had a
pitchfork<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>"</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Doctor, "consider a pitchfork in general;
that is, neither this one nor that one, nor any particular
one, but a pitchfork or pitchforks divested of their
materiality<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>these are things in the abstract."</p>

<p>"They are things in the hay-mow," said Malachi.</p>

<p>"Pray," said Uncle Tim, "have there been many such
things discovered?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>"Discovered!" returned the Doctor, "why, all things,
whether in heaven, or upon the earth, or in the waters
under the earth, whether small or great, visible or invisible,
animate or inanimate; whether the eye can see,
or the ear can hear, or the nose can smell, or the fingers
touch; finally, whatever exists or is imaginable in the
nature of things, past, present, or to come, all may be
abstractions."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Uncle Tim, "pray, what do you make
of the abstraction of a red cow?"</p>

<p>"A red cow," said the Doctor, "considered metaphysically
or as an abstraction, is an animal possessing neither
hide nor horns, bones nor flesh, but is the mere type,
eidolon, and fantastical semblance of these parts of a
quadruped. It has a shape without any substance, and
no color at all, for its redness is the mere counterfeit or
imagination of such. As it lacks the positive, so is it
also deficient in the accidental properties of all the
animals in its tribe, for it has no locomotion, stability, or
endurance, neither goes to pasture, gives milk, chews the
cud, nor performs any other function of the horned
beast, but is a mere creation of the brain, begotten by a
freak of the fancy and nourished by a conceit of the
imagination."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Aunt Judy. "All the metaphysics
under the sun wouldn't make a pound of butter!"</p>

<p>"That's a fact," said Uncle Tim.</p>

<p>East and west and south and north the messengers ride fast,<br />

The horsemen and the footmen are pouring in amain<br />
From many a stately market-place; from many a fruitful plain;<br />
From many a lonely hamlet, which, hid by beech and pine,<br />
Like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest of purple Apennine;<br />
From lordly Volaterr<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>, where scowls the far-famed hold<br />

From seagirt Populonia, whose sentinels descry<br />

From where Cortona lifts to heaven her diadem of towers.</p>

<p>Tall are the oaks whose acorns drop in dark Auser's rill;<br />
Fat are the stags that champ the boughs of the Ciminian hill;<br />
Beyond all streams Clitumnus is to the herdsman dear;<br />
Best of all pools the fowler loves the great Volsinian mere.<br />
But now no stroke of woodman is heard by Auser's rill;<br />
No hunter tracks the stag's green path up the Ciminian hill;<br />
Unwatch'd along Clitumnus grazes the milk-white steer;<br />
Unharm'd the waterfowl may dip in the Volsinian mere.<br />
The harvests of Arretium, this year, old men shall reap;<br />
This year, young boys in Umbro shall plunge the struggling<br />

And in the vats of Luna, this year, the must shall foam<br />
Round the white feet of laughing girls whose sires have march'd<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">to Rome.</span></p>

<p>There be thirty chosen prophets, the wisest of the land,<br />
Who alway by Lars Porsena both morn and evening stand:<br />
Evening and morn the Thirty have turn'd the verses o'er,<br />
Traced from the right on linen white by mighty seers of yore.<br />
And with one voice the Thirty have their glad answer given:<br />
"Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena; go forth, belov'd of heaven.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Go, and return in glory to Clusium's royal dome;<br />
And hang round Nurscia's altars the golden shields of Rome."</p>

<p>And now hath every city sent up her tale of men:<br />
The foot are fourscore thousand, the horse are thousands ten.<br />
Before the gates of Sutrium is met the great array.<br />
A proud man was Lars Porsena upon the trysting day.<br />
For all the Etruscan armies were ranged beneath his eye,<br />
And many a banish'd Roman, and many a stout ally;<br />
And with a mighty following to join the muster came<br />
The Tusculan Mamilius, prince of the Latian name.</p>

<p>But by the yellow Tiber was tumult and affright:<br />
From all the spacious champaign to Rome men took their flight.<br />
A mile around the city, the throng stopp'd up the ways;<br />
A fearful sight it was to see through two long nights and days.<br />
For aged folks on crutches, and women great with child,<br />
And mothers sobbing over babes that clung to them and smiled,<br />
And sick men borne in litters high on the necks of slaves,<br />
And troops of sun-burn'd husbandmen with reaping-hooks and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">staves,</span><br />
And droves of mules and asses laden with skins of wine,<br />
And endless flocks of goats and sheep, and endless herds of<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">kine,</span><br />
And endless trains of wagons that creak'd beneath the weight<br />
Of corn-sacks and of household goods, choked every roaring<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">gate.</span></p>

<p>Now, from the rock Tarpeian, could the wan burghers spy<br />
The line of blazing villages red in the midnight sky.<br />
The Fathers of the City, they sat all night and day,<br />
For every hour some horseman came with tidings of dismay.<br />
To eastward and to westward have spread the Tuscan bands;<br />
Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote in Crustumerium stands.<br />
Verbenna down to Ostia hath wasted all the plain;<br />
Astur hath storm'd Janiculum, and the stout guards are slain.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
I wis, in all the Senate, there was no heart so bold,<br />
But sore it ached, and fast it beat, when that ill news was told.<br />
Forthwith up rose the Consul, up rose the Fathers all;<br />
In haste they girded up their gowns, and hied them to the wall.<br />
They held a council standing, before the River-Gate;<br />
Short time was there, ye well may guess, for musing or debate.<br />
Out spake the Consul roundly: "The bridge must straight go<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">down;</span><br />
For, since Janiculum is lost, nought else can save the town."</p>

<p>Just then a scout came flying, all wild with haste and fear:<br />
"To arms! to arms! Sir Consul: Lars Porsena is here."<br />
On the low hills to westward the Consul fix'd his eye,<br />
And saw the swarthy storm of dust rise fast along the sky.<br />
And nearer fast and nearer doth the red whirlwind come;<br />
And louder still and still more loud, from underneath that rolling<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">cloud,</span><br />
Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud, the trampling, and the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hum.</span><br />
And plainly and more plainly now through the gloom appears,<br />
Far to left and far to right, in broken gleams of dark-blue light,<br />
The long array of helmets bright, the long array of spears.<br />
And plainly and more plainly above that glimmering line,<br />
Now might ye see the banners of twelve fair cities shine;<br />
But the banner of proud Clusium was highest of them all,<br />
The terror of the Umbrian, the terror of the Gaul.<br />
And plainly and more plainly now might the burghers know,<br />
By port and vest, by horse and crest, each warlike Lucumo.<br />
There Cilnius of Arretium on his fleet roan was seen;<br />
And Astur of the four-fold shield, girt with the brand none else<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">may wield,</span><br />
Tolumnius with the belt of gold, and dark Verbenna from the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hold</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">By reedy Thrasymene.</span></p>

<p>Fast by the royal standard, o'erlooking all the war,<br />
Lars Porsena of Clusium sat in his ivory car.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
By the right wheel rode Mamilius, prince of the Latian name;<br />
And by the left false Sextus, that wrought the deed of shame.<br />
But when the face of Sextus was seen among the foes,<br />
A yell that rent the firmament from all the town arose.<br />
On the house-tops was no woman but spat towards him and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hiss'd,</span><br />
No child but scream'd out curses, and shook its little fist.<br />
But the Consul's brow was sad, and the Consul's speech was low,<br />
And darkly look'd he at the wall, and darkly at the foe.<br />
"Their van will be upon us before the bridge goes down;<br />
And if they once may win the bridge, what hope to save the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">town?"</span></p>

<p>Then out spake brave Horatius, the Captain of the Gate:<br />
"To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late.<br />
And how can man die better than facing fearful odds,<br />
For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods,<br />
And for the tender mother who dandled him to rest,<br />
And for the wife who nurses his baby at her breast,<br />
And for the holy maidens who feed the eternal flame,<br />
To save them from false Sextus that wrought the deed of shame?<br />
Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul, with all the speed ye may;<br />
I, with two more to help me, will hold the foe in play.<br />
In yon strait path a thousand may well be stopp'd by three.<br />
Now who will stand on either hand, and keep the bridge with<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">me?"</span></p>

<p>Then out spake Spurius Lartius; a Ramnian proud was he:<br />
"Lo, I will stand at thy right hand, and keep the bridge with<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">thee."</span><br />
And out spake strong Herminius; of Titian blood was he:<br />
"I will abide on thy left side, and keep the bridge with thee."</p>

<p>"Horatius," quoth the Consul, "as thou sayest, so let it be."<br />
And straight against that great array forth went the dauntless<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Three.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
For Romans in Rome's quarrel spared neither land nor gold,<br />
Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life, in the brave days of old.<br />
Then none was for a party; then all were for the state;<br />
Then the great man help'd the poor, and the poor man lov'd<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the great:</span><br />
Then lands were fairly portion'd; then spoils were fairly sold:<br />
The Romans were like brothers in the brave days of old.<br />
Now Roman is to Roman more hateful than a foe,<br />
And the Tribunes beard the high, and the Fathers grind the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">low.</span><br />
As we wax hot in faction, in battle we wax cold:<br />
Wherefore men fight not as they fought in the brave days of old.</p>

<p>Now while the Three were tightening their harness on their<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">backs,</span><br />
The Consul was the foremost man to take in hand an axe:<br />
And Fathers mix'd with Commons seized hatchet, bar, and crow,<br />
And smote upon the planks above, and loosed the props below.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Tuscan army, right glorious to behold,<br />
Came flashing back the noonday light, rank behind rank, like<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">surges bright</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Of a broad sea of gold.</span><br />
Four hundred trumpets sounded a peal of warlike glee,<br />
As that great host, with measured tread, and spears advanced,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and ensigns spread,</span><br />
Roll'd slowly towards the bridge's head, where stood the dauntless<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Three.</span></p>

<p>The Three stood calm and silent, and look'd upon the foes,<br />
And a great shout of laughter from all the vanguard rose:<br />
And forth three chiefs came spurring before that deep array;<br />
To earth they sprang, their swords they drew, and lifted high<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">their shields, and flew</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">To win the narrow way;</span><br />
Aunus from green Tifernum, lord of the Hill of Vines;<br />
And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves sicken in Ilva's mines;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
And Picus, long to Clusium vassal in peace and war,<br />
Who led to fight his Umbrian powers from that gray crag where,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">girt with towers,</span><br />
The fortress of Nequinum lowers o'er the pale waves of Nar.</p>

<p>Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus into the stream beneath:<br />
Herminius struck at Seius, and clove him to the teeth:<br />
At Picus brave Horatius darted one fiery thrust;<br />
And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms clash'd in the bloody<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">dust.</span></p>

<p>Then Ocnus of Falerii rush'd on the Roman Three;<br />
And Lausulus of Urgo, the rover of the sea;<br />
And Aruns of Volsinium, who slew the great wild boar,<br />
The great wild boar that had his den amidst the reeds of Cosa's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">fen,</span><br />
And wasted fields, and slaughter'd men, along Albinia's shore.</p>

<p>Herminius smote down Aruns: Lartius laid Ocnus low:<br />
Right to the heart of Lausulus Horatius sent a blow.<br />
"Lie there," he cried, "fell pirate! no more, aghast and pale,<br />
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark the track of thy<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">destroying bark.</span><br />
No more Campania's hinds shall fly to woods and caverns when<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">they spy.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Thy thrice accurs</span><ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d sail."</p>

<p>But now no sound of laughter was heard among the foes.<br />
A wild and wrathful clamor from all the vanguard rose.<br />
Six spears' lengths from the entrance halted that deep array,<br />
And for a space no man came forth to win the narrow way.</p>

<p>But hark! the cry is Astur: and lo! the ranks divide;<br />
And the great Lord of Luna comes with his stately stride.<br />
Upon his ample shoulders clangs loud the four-fold shield,<br />
And in his hand he shakes the brand which none but he can<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">wield.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
He smiled on those bold Romans a smile serene and high;<br />
He eyed the flinching Tuscans, and scorn was in his eye.<br />
Quoth he, "The she-wolf's litter stand savagely at bay:<br />
But will ye dare to follow, if Astur clears the way?"<br />
Then, whirling up his broadsword with both hands to the height,<br />
He rush'd against Horatius, and smote with all his might.<br />
With shield and blade Horatius right deftly turn'd the blow.<br />
The blow, though turn'd, came yet too nigh; it miss'd his helm,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">but gash'd his thigh:</span><br />
The Tuscans raised a joyful cry to see the red blood flow.<br />
He reel'd, and on Herminius he lean'd one breathing-space;<br />
Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds, sprang right at Astur's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">face.</span><br />
Through teeth, and skull, and helmet, so fierce a thrust he sped,<br />
The good sword stood a hand-breadth out behind the Tuscan's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">head.</span><br />
And the great Lord of Luna fell at that deadly stroke,<br />
As falls on Mount Alvernus a thunder-smitten oak.<br />
Far o'er the crashing forest the giant arms lie spread;<br />
And the pale augurs, muttering low, gaze on the blasted head.<br />
On Astur's throat Horatius right firmly press'd his heel,<br />
And thrice and four times tugg'd amain, ere he wrench'd out<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the steel.</span><br />
"And see," he cried, "the welcome, fair guests, that waits you<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">here!</span><br />
What noble Lucumo comes next to taste our Roman cheer?"</p>

<p>But at his haughty challenge a sullen murmur ran,<br />
Mingled of wrath, and shame, and dread, along that glittering van.<br />
There lack'd not men of prowess, nor men of lordly race;<br />
For all Etruria's noblest were round the fatal place.<br />
But all Etruria's noblest felt their hearts sink to see<br />
On the earth the bloody corpses, in the path the dauntless<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Three:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
And, from the ghastly entrance where those bold Romans stood,<br />
All shrank, like boys who unaware, ranging the woods to start<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">a hare,</span><br />
Come to the mouth of the dark lair where, growling low, a fierce<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">old bear</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Lies amidst bones and blood.</span><br />
Was none who would be foremost to lead such dire attack:<br />
But those behind cried "Forward!" and those before cried<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">"Back!"</span><br />
And backward now and forward wavers the deep array;<br />
And on the tossing sea of steel, to and fro the standards reel;<br />
And the victorious trumpet-peal dies fitfully away.</p>

<p>Yet one man for one moment stood out before the crowd;<br />
Well known was he to all the Three, and they gave him greeting<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">loud.</span><br />
"Now welcome, welcome, Sextus! now welcome to thy home!<br />
Why dost thou stay, and turn away? here lies the road to Rome."<br />
Thrice look'd he at the city; thrice look'd he at the dead;<br />
And thrice came on in fury, and thrice turn'd back in dread;<br />
And, white with fear and hatred, scowl'd at the narrow way<br />
Where, wallowing in a pool of blood, the bravest Tuscans lay.</p>

<p>But meanwhile axe and lever have manfully been plied;<br />
And now the bridge hangs tottering above the boiling tide.<br />
"Come back, come back, Horatius!" loud cried the Fathers all.<br />
"Back, Lartius! back, Herminius! back, ere the ruin fall!"<br />
Back darted Spurius Lartius; Herminius darted back:<br />
And, as they pass'd, beneath their feet they felt the timbers<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">crack.</span><br />
But when they turn'd their faces, and on the farther shore<br />
Saw brave Horatius stand alone, they would have cross'd once<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">more.</span><br />
But with a crash like thunder fell every loosen'd beam,<br />
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream:<br />
And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,<br />
As to the highest turret-tops was splash'd the yellow foam.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
And, like a horse unbroken when first he feels the rein,<br />
The furious river struggled hard, and toss'd his tawny mane,<br />
And burst the curb, and bounded, rejoicing to be free,<br />
And whirling down, in fierce career, battlement, and plank, and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">pier,</span><br />
Rush'd headlong to the sea.</p>

<p>Alone stood brave Horatius, but constant still in mind;<br />
Thrice thirty thousand foes before, and the broad flood behind.<br />
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus, with a smile on his pale<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">face.</span><br />
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena, "now yield thee to our<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">grace."</span><br />
Round turn'd he, as not deigning those craven ranks to see;<br />
Nought spake he to Lars Porsena, to Sextus nought spake he;<br />
But he saw on Palatinus the white porch of his home;<br />
And he spake to the noble river that rolls by the towers of<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Rome.</span><br />
"O Tiber! father Tiber! to whom the Romans pray,<br />
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms, take thou in charge this day!"<br />
So he spake, and speaking sheathed the good sword by his side,<br />
And with his harness on his back plunged headlong in the tide.</p>

<p>No sound of joy or sorrow was heard from either bank;<br />
But friends and foes in dumb surprise, with parted lips and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">straining eyes,</span><br />
Stood gazing where he sank;<br />
And when above the surges they saw his crest appear,<br />
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry, and even the ranks of<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Tuscany</span><br />
Could scarce forbear to cheer.<br />
But fiercely ran the current, swollen high by months of rain:<br />
And fast his blood was flowing, and he was sore in pain,<br />
And heavy with his armor, and spent with changing blows:<br />
And oft they thought him sinking, but still again he rose.<br />
Never, I ween, did swimmer, in such an evil case,<br />
Struggle through such a raging flood safe to the landing-place:<br />
But his limbs were borne up bravely by the brave heart within,<br />
And our good father Tiber bare bravely up his chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
"Curse on him!" quoth false Sextus; "will not the villain<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">drown?</span><br />
But for this stay, ere close of day we should have sack'd the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">town!"</span><br />
"Heaven help him!" quoth Lars Porsena, "and bring him safe<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">to shore;</span><br />
For such a gallant feat of arms was never seen before."<br />
And now he feels the bottom; now on dry earth he stands;<br />
Now round him throng the Fathers to press his gory hands;<br />
And now, with shouts and clapping, and noise of weeping loud,<br />
He enters through the River-Gate, borne by the joyous crowd.</p>

<p>They gave him of the corn-land, that was of public right,<br />
As much as two strong oxen could plough from morn till night;<br />
And they made a molten image, and set it up on high,<br />
And there it stands unto this day to witness if I lie.<br />
It stands in the Comitium, plain for all folk to see;<br />
Horatius in his harness, halting upon one knee:<br />
And underneath is written, in letters all of gold,<br />
How valiantly he kept the bridge in the brave days of old.</p>

<p>And still his name sounds stirring unto the men of Rome,<br />
As the trumpet-blast that cries to them to charge the Volscian<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">home;</span><br />
And wives still pray to Juno for boys with hearts as bold<br />
As his who kept the bridge so well in the brave days of old.<br />
And in the nights of winter, when the cold north-winds blow,<br />
And the long howling of the wolves is heard amidst the snow;<br />
When round the lonely cottage roars loud the tempest's din,<br />
And the good logs of Algidus roar louder yet within;<br />
When the oldest cask is open'd, and the largest lamp is lit;<br />
When the chestnuts glow in the embers, and the kid turns on<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the spit;</span><br />
When young and old in circle around the firebrands close;<br />
When the girls are weaving baskets, and the lads are shaping<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">bows;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
When the goodman mends his armor, and trims his helmet's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">plume;</span><br />
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily goes flashing through the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">loom;</span><br />
With weeping and with laughter still is the story told,<br />
How well Horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old.<br /><br /></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Edgar Allan Poe</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1809-1849.</h4>

<div class="block" style="width: 600px;">
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd, weak and weary,<br />
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door.<br />
"'Tis some visitor," I mutter'd, "tapping at my chamber-door,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Only this, and nothing more."</span></p>

<p>Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,<br />
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br />
Eagerly I wish'd the morrow: vainly I had sought to borrow<br />
From my books surcease of sorrow,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>sorrow for the lost Lenore;<br />
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Nameless here forevermore.</span></p>

<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />
Thrill'd me<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>fill'd me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br />
"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Some late visitor, entreating entrance at my chamber-door;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">This it is, and nothing more."</span></p>

<p>Presently my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer,<br />
"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br />
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber-door,<br />
That I scarce was sure I heard you";<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>here I open'd wide the door;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Darkness there, and nothing more.</span></p>

<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">fearing,</span><br />
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br />
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br />
And the only word there spoken was the whisper'd word "Lenore?"<br />
This I whisper'd, and an echo murmur'd back the word "Lenore!"<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Merely this, and nothing more.</span></p>

<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br />
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.<br />
"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window-lattice;<br />
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">'Tis the wind, and nothing more."</span></p>

<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br />
In there stepp'd a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br />
Not the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopp'd or stay'd he,<br />
But, with mien of lord or lady, perch'd above my chamber-door;<br />
Perch'd upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber-door;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Perch'd, and sat, and nothing more.</span></p>

<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br />
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">no craven,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the Nightly<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">shore;</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore."<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span></p>

<p>Much I marvell'd this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br />
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;<br />
For we can not help agreeing that no living human being<br />
Ever yet was bless'd with seeing bird above his chamber-door,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber-door,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">With such name as "Nevermore."</span></p>

<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br />
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br />
Nothing further then he utter'd, not a feather then he flutter'd,<br />
Till I scarcely more than mutter'd, "Other friends have flown before:<br />
On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</span></p>

<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br />
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br />
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster<br />
Follow'd fast, and follow'd faster, till his songs one burden bore,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Of</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>'Never<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Nevermore.'"</p>

<p>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br />
Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in front of bird, and bust,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and door;</span><br />
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br />
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">of yore</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burn'd into my bosom's core:<br />
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er;<br />
But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;"><i>She</i> shall press</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>ah! nevermore.</p>

<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">censer</span><br />
Swung by seraphim, whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br />
"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>by these angels<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">he hath sent thee</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Respite, respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br />
Quaff, Oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</span></p>

<p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>prophet still, if bird or devil!<br />
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest toss'd thee here<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">ashore,</span><br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> can be but partially acquainted even with the
events which actually influence our course through life,
and our final destiny. There are innumerable other
events, if such they may be called, which come close
upon us, yet pass away without actual results, or even
betraying their near approach by the reflection of any
light or shadow across our minds. Could we know all
the vicissitudes of our fortunes, life would be too full of
hope and fear, exultation or disappointment, to afford us
a single hour of true serenity. This idea may be illustrated
by a page from the secret history of David Swan.</p>

<p>We have nothing to do with David until we find him,
at the age of twenty, on the high road from his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
place to the city of Boston, where his uncle, a small
dealer in the grocery line, was to take him behind the
counter. Be it enough to say, that he was a native of
New Hampshire, born of respectable parents, and had
received an ordinary school education, with a classic finish
by a year at Gilmanton Academy. After journeying on
foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summer's day, his
weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit
down in the first convenient shade, and await the coming
up of the stage-coach. As if planted on purpose for
him, there soon appeared a little tuft of maples, with a
delightful recess in the midst, and such a fresh bubbling
spring, that it seemed never to have sparkled for any
wayfarer but David Swan. Virgin or not, he kissed it
with his thirsty lips, and then flung himself along the
brink, pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair of
pantaloons, tied up in a striped cotton handkerchief. The
sunbeams could not reach him; the dust did not yet rise
from the road, after the heavy rain of yesterday; and his
grassy lair suited the young man better than a bed of
down. The spring murmured drowsily beside him; the
branches waved dreamily across the blue sky overhead;
and a deep sleep, perchance hiding dreams within its
depths, fell upon David Swan. But we are to relate
events which he did not dream of.</p>

<p>While he lay sound asleep in the shade, other people
were wide-awake, and passed to an fro, afoot, on horseback,
and in all sorts of vehicles, along the sunny road
by his bed-chamber. Some looked neither to the right
hand nor to the left, and knew not that he was there;
some merely glanced that way, without admitting the
slumberer among their busy thoughts; some laughed to
see how soundly he slept; and several, whose hearts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
brimming full of scorn, ejected their venomous superfluity
upon David Swan. A middle-aged widow, when
nobody else was near, thrust her head a little way into
the recess, and vowed that the young fellow looked charming
in his sleep. A temperance lecturer saw him, and
wrought poor David into the texture of his evening's
discourse, as an awful instance of dead-drunkenness by
the road-side. But censure, praise, merriment, scorn, and
indifference, were all one, or rather all nothing, to David
Swan.</p>

<p>He had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage,
drawn by a handsome pair of horses, bowled easily
along, and was brought to a stand-still nearly in front of
David's resting-place. A linch-pin had fallen out, and
permitted one of the wheels to slide off. The damage
was slight, and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to
an elderly merchant and his wife, who were returning to
Boston in the carriage. While the coachman and a servant
were replacing the wheel, the lady and gentleman
sheltered themselves beneath the maple-trees, and there
espied the bubbling fountain, and David Swan asleep beside
it. Impressed with the awe which the humblest
sleeper usually sheds around him, the merchant trod as
lightly as the gout would allow; and his spouse took
good heed not to rustle her silk gown, lest David should
start up, all of a sudden.</p>

<p>"How soundly he sleeps!" whispered the old gentleman.
"From what a depth he draws that easy breath!
Such sleep as that, brought on without an opiate, would
be worth more to me than half my income, for it would
suppose health and an untroubled mind."</p>

<p>"And youth besides," said the lady. "Healthy and
quiet age does not sleep thus. Our slumber is no more
like his than our wakefulness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>The longer they looked, the more did this elderly couple
feel interested in the unknown youth, to whom the wayside
and the maple shade were as a secret chamber, with
the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding over him.
Perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon
his face, the lady contrived to twist a branch aside, so as
to intercept it. And having done this little act of kindness,
she began to feel like a mother to him.</p>

<p>"Providence seems to have laid him here," whispered
she to her husband, "and to have brought us hither to
find him, after our disappointment in our cousin's son.
Methinks I can see a likeness to our departed Henry.
Shall we waken him?"</p>

<p>"To what purpose?" said the merchant, hesitating.
"We know nothing of the youth's character."</p>

<p>"That open countenance!" replied his wife, in the same
hushed voice, yet earnestly. "This innocent sleep!"</p>

<p>While these whispers were passing, the sleeper's heart
did not throb, nor his breath become agitated, nor his
features betray the least token of interest. Yet Fortune
was bending over him, just ready to let fall a burthen of
gold. The old merchant had lost his only son, and had
no heir to his wealth, except a distant relative, with whose
conduct he was dissatisfied. In such cases, people sometimes
do stranger things than to act the magician, and
awaken a young man to splendor, who fell asleep in
poverty.</p>

<p>"Shall we not waken him?" repeated the lady, persuasively.</p>

<p>"The coach is ready, sir," said the servant, behind.</p>

<p>The old couple started, reddened, and hurried away,
mutually wondering that they should ever have dreamed
of doing anything so very ridiculous. The merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
threw himself back in the carriage, and occupied his mind
with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate
men of business. Meanwhile, David Swan enjoyed his
nap.</p>

<p>The carriage could not have gone above a mile or two,
when a pretty young girl came along with a tripping
pace, which showed precisely how her little heart was
dancing in her bosom. Perhaps it was this merry kind
of motion that caused<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>is there any harm in saying it?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>her
garter to slip its knot. Conscious that the silken
girth, if silk it were, was relaxing its hold, she turned
aside into the shelter of the maple-trees, and there found
a young man asleep by the spring! Blushing as red as
any rose, that she should have intruded into a gentleman's
bed-chamber, and for such a purpose, too, she was
about to make her escape on tiptoe. But there was peril
near the sleeper. A monster of a bee had been wandering
overhead<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>buzz, buzz, buzz<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now among the leaves,
now flashing through the strips of sunshine, and now lost
in the dark shade, till finally he appeared to be settling
on the eyelid of David Swan. The sting of a bee is
sometimes deadly. As free-hearted as she was innocent,
the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief,
brushed him soundly, and drove him from the maple shade.
How sweet a picture! This good deed accomplished,
with quickened breath, and a deeper blush, she stole a
glance at the youthful stranger, for whom she had been
battling with a dragon in the air.</p>

<p>"He is handsome!" thought she, and blushed redder yet.</p>

<p>How could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong
within him, that, shattered by its very strength, it should
part asunder, and allow him to perceive the girl among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
its phantoms? Why, at least, did no smile of welcome
brighten upon his face? She was come, the maid whose
soul, according to the old and beautiful idea, had been
severed from his own, and whom, in all his vague but
passionate desires, he yearned to meet. Her only could
he love with a perfect love<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>him only could she receive
into the depths of her heart<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and now her image was
faintly blushing in the fountain by his side; should it
pass away, its happy lustre would never gleam upon his
life again.</p>

<p>"How sound he sleeps!" murmured the girl.</p>

<p>She departed, but did not trip along the road so lightly
as when she came.</p>

<p>Now, this girl's father was a thriving country merchant
in the neighborhood, and happened, at that identical
time, to be looking out for just such a young man as
David Swan. Had David formed a wayside acquaintance
with the daughter, he would have become the
father's clerk, and all else in natural succession. So
here, again, had good fortune<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the best of fortunes<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>stolen
so near, that her garments brushed against him;
and he knew nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>The girl was hardly out of sight, when two men turned
aside beneath the maple shade. Both had dark faces, set
off by cloth caps, which were drawn down aslant over
their brows. Their dresses were shabby, yet had a certain
smartness. These were a couple of rascals, who
got their living by whatever the devil sent them, and now,
in the interim of other business, had staked the joint
profits of their next piece of villainy on a game of cards,
which was to have been decided here under the trees.
But, finding David asleep by the spring, one of the rogues
whispered to his fellow<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>"Hist!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Do you see that bundle under his head?"</p>

<p>The other villain nodded, winked, and leered.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a horn of brandy," said the first, "that
the chap has either a pocket-book or a snug little hoard
of small change, stowed away amongst his shirts. And if
not there, we shall find it in his pantaloons' pocket."</p>

<p>"But how if he wakes?" said the other.</p>

<p>His companion thrust aside his waistcoat, pointed to
the handle of a dirk, and nodded.</p>

<p>"So be it!" muttered the second villain.</p>

<p>They approached the unconscious David, and, while
one pointed the dagger towards his heart, the other began
to search the bundle beneath his head. Their two faces,
grim, wrinkled, and ghastly with guilt and fear, bent over
their victim, looking horribly enough to be mistaken for
fiends, should he suddenly awake. Nay, had the villains
glanced aside into the spring, even they would hardly
have known themselves, as reflected there. But David
Swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect, even when
asleep on his mother's breast.</p>

<p>"I must take away the bundle," whispered one.</p>

<p>"If he stirs, I'll strike," muttered the other.</p>

<p>But, at this moment, a dog, scenting along the ground,
came in beneath the maple-trees, and gazed alternately
at each of these wicked men, and then at the quiet sleeper.
He then lapped out of the fountain.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said one villain. "We can do nothing now.
The dog's master must be close behind."</p>

<p>"Let's take a drink, and be off," said the other.</p>

<p>The man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into
his bosom, and drew forth a pocket-pistol, but not of that
kind which kills by a single discharge. It was a flask of
liquor, with a block-tin tumbler screwed upon the mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Each drank a comfortable dram, and left the spot, with
so many jests, and such laughter at their unaccomplished
wickedness, that they might be said to have gone on their
way rejoicing. In a few hours they had forgotten the
whole affair, nor once imagined that the recording angel
had written down the crime of murder against their
souls, in letters as durable as eternity. As for David
Swan, he still slept quietly, neither conscious of the shadow
of death when it hung over him, nor of the glow of
renewed life when that shadow was withdrawn.</p>

<p>He slept, but no longer so quietly as at first. An hour's
repose had snatched from his elastic frame the weariness
with which many hours of toil had burthened it. Now he
stirred<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now moved his lips, without a sound<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now
talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres of his
dream. But a noise of wheels came rattling louder and
louder along the road, until it dashed through the dispersing
mist of David's slumber<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and there was the stage-coach.
He started up, with all his ideas about him.</p>

<p>"Hallo, driver! Take a passenger?" shouted he.</p>

<p>"Room on top!" answered the driver.</p>

<p>Up mounted David, and bowled away merrily towards
Boston, without so much as a parting glance at that
fountain of dreamlike vicissitude. He knew not that a
phantom of Wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its
waters, nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their
murmur, nor that one of Death had threatened to crimson
them with his blood<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>all, in the brief hour since he lay
down to sleep. Sleeping or waking, we hear not the
airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen.
Does it not argue a superintending Providence, that,
while viewless and unexpected events thrust themselves
continually athwart our path, there should still be regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>larity
enough in mortal life, to render foresight even partially
available?</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so we have now nothing more;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and Oliver has
nothing more. His Speakings, and also his Actings, all
his manifold Strugglings, more or less victorious, to utter
the great God's-Message that was in him,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>have here
what we call ended. This Summer of 1658, likewise victorious
after struggle, is his last in our World of Time.
Thenceforth he enters the Eternities; and rests upon his
arms <i>there</i>.</p>

<p>Oliver's look was yet strong; and young for his years,
which were Fifty-nine last April. The "Three-score and
ten years," the Psalmist's limit, which probably was often
in Oliver's thoughts and in those of others there, might
have been anticipated for him: Ten Years more of Life;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>which,
we may compute, would have given another
History to all the Centuries of England. But it was not
to be so, it was to be otherwise. Oliver's health, as we
might observe, was but uncertain in late times; often
"indisposed" the spring before last. His course of life
had not been favorable to health! "A burden too heavy
for man!" as he himself, with a sigh, would sometimes
say. Incessant toil; inconceivable labor, of head and
heart and hand; toil, peril, and sorrow manifold, continued
for near Twenty years now, had done their part: those
robust life-energies, it afterwards appeared, had been
gradually eaten out. Like a Tower strong to the eye, but
with its foundations undermined; which has not long to
stand; the fall of which, on any shock, may be sudden.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>The Manzinis and Ducs de Crequi, with their splendors,
and congratulations about Dunkirk, interesting
to the street-populations and general public, had not
yet withdrawn, when at Hampton Court there had begun
a private scene, of much deeper and quite opposite
interest there. The Lady Claypole, Oliver's favorite
Daughter, a favorite of all the world, had fallen sick we
know not when; lay sick now,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>to death, as it proved.
Her disease was of a nature, the painfullest and most
harassing to mind and sense, it is understood, that falls to
the lot of a human creature. Hampton Court we can
fancy once more, in those July days, a house of sorrow;
pale Death knocking there, as at the door of the meanest
hut. "She had great sufferings, great exercises of spirit."
Yes:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and in the depths of the old Centuries, we see a
pale anxious Mother, anxious Husband, anxious weeping
Sisters, a poor young Frances weeping anew in her weeds.
"For the last fourteen days" his Highness had been by her
bedside at Hampton Court, unable to attend to any public
business whatever. Be still, my Child; trust thou yet in
God: in the waves of the Dark River, there too is He a
God of help!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>On the 6th day of August she lay dead;
at rest forever. My young, my beautiful, my brave! She
is taken from me; I am left bereaved of her. The Lord
giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the Name
of the Lord!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>...</p>

<p>In the same dark days, occurred George Fox's third
and last interview with Oliver.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>.... George dates nothing;
and his facts everywhere lie round him like the leather-parings
of his old shop: but we judge it may have been
about the time when the Manzinis and the Ducs de Crequi
were parading in their gilt coaches, That George and two
Friends "going out of Town," on a summer day, "two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of Hacker's men" had met them,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>taken them, brought
them to the Mews. "Prisoners there awhile:"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>but the
Lord's power was over Hacker's men; they had to let us
go. Whereupon:</p>

<p>"The same day, taking boat I went down" (<i>up</i>) "to Kingston,
and from thence to Hampton Court, to speak with
the Protector about the Sufferings of Friends. I met him
riding into Hampton-Court Park; and before I came to
him, as he rode at the head of his Lifeguard, I saw and
felt a waft" (<i>whiff</i>) "of death go forth against him."<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>Or
in favor of him, George? His life, if thou knew
it, has not been a merry thing for this man, now or heretofore!
I fancy he has been looking, this long while, to
give it up, whenever the Commander-in-Chief required.
To quit his laborious sentry-post; honorably lay-up his
arms, and be gone to his rest:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>all Eternity to rest in, O
George! Was thy own life merry, for example, in the
hollow of the tree; clad permanently in leather? And
does kingly purple, and governing refractory worlds instead
of stitching coarse shoes, make it merrier? The
waft of death is not against <i>him</i>, I think,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>perhaps against
thee, and me, and others, O George, when the Nell-Gwynn
Defender and Two Centuries of all-victorious Cant have
come in upon us! My unfortunate George<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>"a waft
of death go forth against him; and when I came to him,
he looked like a dead man. After I had laid the Sufferings
of Friends before him, and had warned him according
as I was moved to speak to him, he bade me come to
his house. So I returned to Kingston; and, the next day,
went up to Hampton Court to speak farther with him.
But when I came, Harvey, who was one that waited on
him, told me the Doctors were not willing that I should
speak with him. So I passed away, and never saw him
more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Friday the 20th of August 1658, this was probably
the day on which George Fox saw Oliver riding into
Hampton Park with his Guards, for the last time. That
Friday, as we find, his Highness seemed much better:
but on the morrow a sad change had taken place; feverish
symptoms, for which the Doctors rigorously prescribed
quiet. Saturday to Tuesday the symptoms continued
ever worsening: a kind of tertian ague, "bastard tertian"
as the old Doctors name it; for which it was ordered
that his Highness should return to Whitehall, as to a
more favorable air in that complaint. On Tuesday accordingly
he quitted Hampton Court;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>never to see it
more.</p>

<p>"His time was come," says Harvey; "and neither
prayers nor tears could prevail with God to lengthen out
his life and continue him longer to us. Prayers abundantly
and incessantly poured out on his behalf, both
publicly and privately, as was observed, in a more than
ordinary way. Besides many a secret sigh,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>secret and
unheard by men, yet like the cry of Moses, more loud,
and strongly laying hold on God, than many spoken supplications.
All which,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the hearts of God's People being
thus mightily stirred up,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>did seem to beget confidence
in some, and hopes in all; yea some thoughts in himself,
that God would restore him."</p>

<p>"Prayers public and private:" they are worth imagining
to ourselves. Meetings of Preachers, Chaplains, and
Godly Persons; "Owen, Goodwin, Sterry, with a company
of others, in an adjoining room"; in Whitehall, and
elsewhere over religious London and England, fervent
outpourings of many a loyal heart. For there were hearts
to whom the nobleness of this man was known; and
his worth to the Puritan Cause was evident. Prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>strange
enough to us; in a dialect fallen obsolete, forgotten
now. Authentic wrestlings of ancient Human
Souls,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who were alive then, with their affections, awestruck
pieties; with their Human Wishes, risen to be
<i>transcendent</i>, hoping to prevail with the Inexorable. All
swallowed now in the depths of dark Time; which is full
of such, since the beginning!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Truly it is a great scene
of World-History, this in old Whitehall: Oliver Cromwell
drawing nigh to his end. The exit of Oliver Cromwell
and of English Puritanism; a great Light, one of
our few authentic Solar Luminaries, going down now
amid the clouds of Death. Like the setting of a great
victorious Summer Sun; its course now finished. "<i>So
stirbt ein Held</i>," says Schiller, "So dies a Hero! Sight
worthy to be worshipped!"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>He died, this Hero Oliver,
in Resignation to God; as the Brave have all done. "We
could not be more desirous he should abide," says the
pious Harvey, "than he was content and willing to be
gone." The struggle lasted, amid hope and fear, for ten
days....</p>

<p>On Monday August 30th, there roared and howled all
day a mighty storm of wind.... It was on this stormy
Monday, while rocking winds, heard in the sickroom and
everywhere, were piping aloud, that Thurloe and an
Official person entered to enquire, Who, in case of the
worst, was to be his Highness's Successor? The Successor
is named in a sealed Paper already drawn-up, above
a year ago, at Hampton Court; now lying in such and
such a place. The Paper was sent for, searched for; it
could never be found. Richard's is the name understood
to have been written in that Paper: not a good name;
but in fact one does not know. In ten years' time, had
ten years more been granted, Richard might have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a fitter man; might have been cancelled, if palpably unfit.
Or perhaps it was Fleetwood's name,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and the Paper,
by certain parties, was stolen? None knows. On the
Thursday night following, "and not till then," his Highness
is understood to have formally named "Richard",<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>or
perhaps it might only be some heavy-laden "Yes,
yes!" spoken, out of the thick death-slumbers, in answer
to Thurloe's <i>question</i> "Richard?" The thing is a little
uncertain. It was, once more, a matter of much moment;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>giving
color probably to all the subsequent
Centuries of England, this answer!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>...</p>

<p>Thursday night the Writer of our old Pamphlet
[Harvey] was himself in attendance on his Highness;
and has preserved a trait or two; with which let us hasten
to conclude. Tomorrow is September Third, always
kept as a Thanksgiving day, since the Victories of Dunbar
and Worcester. The wearied one, "that very night
before the Lord took him to his everlasting rest," was
heard thus, with oppressed voice, speaking:</p>

<p>"'Truly God is good; indeed He is; He will not'<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>Then
his speech failed him, but as I apprehended, it was,
'He will not leave me.' This saying, 'God is good,' he
frequently used all along; and would speak it with much
cheerfulness, and fervor of spirit, in the midst of his
pains.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Again he said: 'I would be willing to live to be
farther serviceable to God and His People: but my work
is done. Yet God will be with His People.'</p>

<p>"He was very restless most part of the night, speaking
often to himself. And there being something to drink
offered him, he was desired To take the same, and endeavor
to sleep.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Unto which he answered: 'It is not
my design to drink or sleep; but my design is, to make
what haste I can to be gone.'<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>"Afterwards, towards morning, he used divers holy expressions,
implying much inward consolation and peace;
among the rest he spake some exceeding self-debasing
words, <i>annihilating</i> and judging himself. And truly it
was observed, that a public spirit to God's Cause did
breathe in him,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>as in his lifetime, so now to his very
last."</p>

<p>When the morrow's sun rose, Oliver was speechless;
between three and four in the afternoon, he lay dead.
Friday 3rd September 1658. "The consternation and
astonishment of all people," writes Fauconberg, "are inexpressible;
their hearts seem as if sunk within them.
My poor Wife,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I know not what on earth to do with
her. When seemingly quieted, she bursts out again into
a passion that tears her very heart in pieces."<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Husht,
poor weeping Mary! Here is a Life-battle right nobly
done. Seest thou not,</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 260px; font-size: smaller;">
<p>"The storm is changed into a calm,<br />
At His command and will;<br />
So that the waves which raged before<br />
Now quiet are and still!</p>

<p>"Then are <i>they</i> glad,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>because at rest<br />
And quiet now they be:<br />
So to the haven He them brings<br />
Which they desired to see."</p>
</div>

<p>"Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord;" blessed
are the valiant that have lived in the Lord. "Amen,
saith the Spirit,"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Amen. "They do rest from their
labors, and their works follow them."</p>

<p>"Their works follow them." As, I think, this Oliver Cromwell's
works have done and are still doing! We have had
our "Revolutions of Eighty-eight," officially called "glorious";
and other Revolutions not yet called glorious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and somewhat has been gained for poor Mankind. Men's
ears are not now slit-off by rash Officiality; Officiality
will, for long henceforth, be more cautious about men's
ears. The tyrannous Star-chambers, branding-irons,
chimerical Kings and Surplices at All-hallowtide, they
are gone, or with immense velocity going. Oliver's
works do follow him!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>The works of a man, bury them
under what guano-mountains and obscene owl-droppings
you will, do not perish, cannot perish. What of Heroism,
what of Eternal Light was in a Man and his Life, is with
very great exactness added to the Eternities; remains forever
a new divine portion of the Sum of Things; and no
owl's voice, this way or that, in the least avails in the
matter.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>But we have to end here.</p>

<p>Oliver is gone; and with him England's Puritanism,
laboriously built together by this man, and made a thing
far-shining, miraculous to its own Century, and memorable
to all the Centuries, soon goes. Puritanism, without
its King, is <i>kingless</i>, anarchic; falls into dislocation, self-collision;
staggers, plunges into ever deeper anarchy;
King, Defender of the Puritan Faith there can now none
be found;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and nothing is left but to recall the old disowned
Defender with the remnants of his Four Surplices, and
Two Centuries of <i>Hypocrisis</i> (or Play-acting <i>not</i> so-called),
and put-up with all that, the best we may. The Genius
of England no longer soars Sunward, world-defiant, like
an Eagle through the storms, "mewing her mighty
youth," as John Milton saw her do: the Genius of England,
much liker a greedy Ostrich intent on provender
and a whole skin mainly, stands with its <i>other</i> extremity
Sunward; with its Ostrich-head stuck into the readiest
bush, of old Church-tippets, King-cloaks, or what other
"sheltering Fallacy" there may be, and <i>so</i> awaits the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
issue. The issue has been slow; but it is now seen to
have been inevitable. No Ostrich, intent on gross terrene
provender, and sticking its head into Fallacies, but will be
awakened one day,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in a terrible <ins class="translit" title="a grave"><i>&#224;</i></ins><i>-posteriori</i> manner, if
not otherwise!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>--Awake before it come to that; gods
and men bid us awake! The Voices of our Fathers, with
thousand-fold stern monition to one and all, bid us awake.<br /><br /></p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Charles O'Malley</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span> is the officer that I spoke of," said an aid-de-camp,
as he rode up to where I was standing, bare-headed
and without a sword. "He has just made his escape
from the French lines, and will be able to give your
lordship some information."</p>

<p>The handsome features and gorgeous costume of Lord
Uxbridge were known to me; but I was not aware, till
afterwards, that a soldierlike, resolute looking officer beside
him, was General Graham. It was the latter who
first addressed me.</p>

<p>"Are you aware, Sir," said he, "if Grouchy's force is
arrived?"</p>

<p>"They had not: on the contrary, shortly before I
escaped, an aid-de-camp was despatched to Gembloux,
to hasten his coming. And the troops, for they must be
troops, debouching from the wood yonder<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they seem
to form a junction with the corps to the right<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they
are the Prussians. They arrived there before noon from
St. Lambert, and are part of B<ins class="translit" title="u diaresis">&#252;</ins>low's corps. Count
L<ins class="translit" title="o diaresis">&#246;</ins>bau and his division of ten thousand men were despatched,
about an hour since, to hold them in check."</p>

<p>"This is great news," said Lord Uxbridge. "Fitzroy
must know it at once."</p>

<p>So saying he dashed spurs into his horse, and soon disappeared
amid the crowd on the hill top.</p>

<p>"You had better see the Duke, Sir," said Graham:
"your information is too important to be delayed. Captain
Calvert, let this officer have a horse; his own is too
tired to go much further."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>"And a cap, I beg of you," added I, in an under tone;
"for I have already found a sabre."</p>

<p>By a slight circuitous route, we reached the road upon
which a mass of dismounted artillery-carts, baggage-wagons,
and tumbrils, were heaped together as a barricade
against the attack of the French dragoons, who more
than once had penetrated to the very crest of our position.
Close to this, and on a little rising ground, from
which a view of the entire field extended from Hougoumont
to the far left, the Duke of Wellington stood, surrounded
by his staff. His eye was bent upon the valley
before him, where the advancing columns of Ney's attack
still pressed onwards; while the fire of sixty great guns
poured death and carnage into his lines. The second
Belgian division, routed and broken, had fallen back upon
the twenty-seventh regiment, who had merely time to
throw themselves into square, when Milhaud's cuirassiers,
armed with a terrible long straight sword, came sweeping
down upon them. A line of impassable bayonets, a
living <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of the best blood of Britain, stood
firm and motionless before the shock: the French
<i>mitraille</i> played mercilessly on the ranks; but the chasms
were filled up like magic, and in vain the bold horsemen
of Gaul galloped round the bristling files. At length
the word "fire!" was heard within the square, and as the
bullets at pistol range rattled upon them, the cuirass afforded
them no defence against the deadly volley. Men
and horses rolled indiscriminately upon the earth: then
would come a charge of our dashing squadrons, who,
riding recklessly upon the foe, were, in their turn, to be
repulsed by numbers, when fresh attacks would pour
down upon our unshaken infantry.</p>

<p>"That column yonder is wavering: why does he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
bring up his supporting squadrons?" inquired the Duke,
pointing to a Belgian regiment of light dragoons, who
were formed in the same brigade with the seventh hussars.</p>

<p>"He refuses to oppose his light cavalry to cuirassiers,
my lord," said an aid-de-camp, who had just returned
from the division in question.</p>

<p>"Tell him to march his men off the ground," said the
Duke, with a quiet and impassive tone.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes the regiment was seen to defile
from the mass, and take the road to Brussels, to increase
the panic of that city, by circulating and strengthening
the report, that the English were beaten,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
Napoleon in full march upon the capital.</p>

<p>"What's Ney's force? can you guess, Sir?" said Lord
Wellington turning to me.</p>

<p>"About twelve thousand men, my lord."</p>

<p>"Are the Guard among them?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir; the Guard are in reserve above La Belle
Alliance."</p>

<p>"In what part of the field is Buonaparte?"</p>

<p>"Nearly opposite to where we stand."</p>

<p>"I told you, gentlemen, Hougoumont never was the
great attack. The battle must be decided here," pointing,
as he spoke, to the plain beneath us, where still Ney
poured on his devoted columns, where yet the French
cavalry rode down upon our firm squares.</p>

<p>As he spoke an aid-de-camp rode up from the valley.</p>

<p>"The ninety-second requires support, my lord: they
cannot maintain their positions half an hour longer,
without it."</p>

<p>"Have they given way, Sir?"</p>

<p>"No<ins class="translit" title="em dash em dash"><span style="letter-spacing: -2px; white-space: nowrap;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></ins>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
"Well, then, they must stand where they are. I hear
cannon towards the left; yonder, near Frischermont."</p>

<p>At this moment the light cavalry swept past the base
of the hill on which we stood, hotly followed by the
French heavy cuirassier brigade. Three of our guns
were taken; and the cheering of the French infantry, as
they advanced to the charge, presaged their hope of
victory.</p>

<p>"Do it, then," said the Duke, in reply to some whispered
question of Lord Uxbridge; and shortly after the heavy
trot of advancing squadrons was heard behind.</p>

<p>They were the Life Guards and the Blues, who, with
the first Dragoon Guards and the Enniskilleners, were
formed into close column.</p>

<p>"I know the ground, my Lord," said I to Lord Uxbridge.</p>

<p>"Come along, Sir, come along," said he, as he threw
his hussar jacket loosely behind him, to give freedom
to his sword-arm.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Forward, my men, forward; but
steady, hold your horses in hand; threes about, and together
charge."</p>

<p>"Charge!" he shouted; while, as the word flew from
squadron to squadron, each horseman bent upon his
saddle, and that mighty mass, as though instinct with but
one spirit, dashed like a thunder-bolt upon the column
beneath them. The French, blown and exhausted, inferior
beside in weight both of man and horse, offered
but a short resistance. As the tall corn bends beneath
the sweeping hurricane, wave succeeding wave, so did the
steel-clad squadrons of France fall before the nervous
arm of Britain's cavalry. Onward they went, carrying
death and ruin before them, and never stayed their course,
until the guns were recaptured, and the cuirassiers, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>pulsed,
disordered, and broken, had retired beneath the
protection of their artillery.</p>

<p>There was, as a brilliant and eloquent writer on the
subject mentions, a terrible sameness in the whole of this
battle. Incessant charges of cavalry upon the squares
of our infantry, whose sole man<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>uvre consisted in either
deploying into line to resist the attack of infantry, or
falling back into square when the cavalry advanced<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>performing
those two evolutions under the devastating fire of
artillery, before the unflinching heroism of that veteran
infantry whose glories had been reaped upon the blood-stained
fields of Austerlitz, Marengo, and Wagram<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>or
opposing an unbroken front to the whirlwind swoop
of infuriated cavalry;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>such were the enduring and devoted
services demanded from the English troops, and
such they failed not to render. Once or twice had temper
nearly failed them, and the cry ran through the ranks,
"Are we never to move forward?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Only let us at them!"
But the word was not yet spoken which was to undam
the pent-up torrent, and bear down with unrelenting
vengeance upon the now exulting columns of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock: the battle had continued with unchanged
fortune for three hours. The French, masters
of La Haye Sainte, could never advance further into
our position. They had gained the orchard of Hougoumont,
but the ch<ins class="translit" title="a circumflex">&#226;</ins>teau was still held by the British Guards,
although its blazing roof and crumbling walls made its
occupation rather the desperate stand of unflinching
valor than the maintenance of an important position.
The smoke which hung upon the field rolled in slow
and heavy masses back upon the French lines, and gradually
discovered to our view the entire of the army. We
quickly perceived that a change was taking place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
their position. The troops which on their left stretched
far beyond Hougoumont, were now moved nearer to the
centre. The attack upon the ch<ins class="translit" title="a circumflex">&#226;</ins>teau seemed less vigorously
supported, while the oblique direction of their right
wing, which, pivoting upon Planchenoit, opposed a face
to the Prussians,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>all denoted a change in their order of
battle. It was now the hour when Napoleon was at last
convinced that nothing but the carnage he could no longer
support could destroy the unyielding ranks of British infantry;
that although Hougoumont had been partially,
La Haye Sainte, completely, won; that although upon
the right the farm-houses Papelotte and La Haye were
nearly surrounded by his troops, which with any other
army must prove the forerunner of defeat: yet still the
victory was beyond his grasp. The bold stratagems,
whose success the experience of a life had proved, were
here to be found powerless. The decisive man<ins class="translit" title="oe ligature">&#339;</ins>uvre of
carrying one important point of the enemy's lines, of
turning him upon the flank, or piercing him through the
centre, were here found impracticable. He might launch
his avalanche of grape-shot, he might pour down his
crashing columns of cavalry, he might send forth the iron
storm of his brave infantry; but, though death in every
shape heralded their approach, still were others found to
fill the fallen ranks, and feed with their heart's blood the
unslaked thirst for slaughter. Well might the gallant
leader of this gallant host, as he watched the reckless
onslaught of the untiring enemy, and looked upon the
unflinching few, who, bearing the proud badge of Britain,
alone sustained the fight, well might he exclaim, "Night,
or Bl<ins class="translit" title="u diaresis">&#252;</ins>cher!"</p>

<p>It was now seven o'clock, when a dark mass was seen
to form upon the heights above the French centre, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
divide into three gigantic columns, of which the right
occupied the Brussels road. These were the reserves,
consisting of the Old and Young Guards, and amounting
to twelve thousand<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the <ins class="translit" title="e acute"><i>&#233;</i></ins><i>lite</i> of the French army<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>reserved
by the Emperor for a great <i>coup-de-main</i>. These
veterans of a hundred battles had been stationed, from the
beginning of the day, inactive spectators of the fight;
their hour was now come, and, with a shout of "<i>Vive
l'Empereur!</i>" which rose triumphantly over the din and
crash of battle, they began their march. Meanwhile,
aids-de-camp galloped along the lines, announcing the
arrival of Grouchy, to reanimate the drooping spirits of
the men; for, at last, a doubt of victory was breaking
upon the minds of those who never before, in the most
adverse hour of fortune, deemed <i>his</i> star could set that
led them on to glory.</p>

<p>"They are coming: the attack will be made on the
centre, my lord," said Lord Fitzroy Somerset, as he directed
his glass upon the column. Scarcely had he spoke
when the telescope fell from his hand, as his arm, shattered
by a French bullet, fell motionless to his side.</p>

<p>"I see it," was the cool reply of the Duke, as he ordered
the Guards to deploy into line, and lie down behind
the ridge, which now the French artillery had found the
range of, and were laboring at with their guns. In front
of them the fifty-second, seventy-first, and ninety-fifth
were formed; the artillery, stationed above and partly
upon the road, loaded with grape, and waited but the
word to open.</p>

<p>It was an awful, a dreadful moment: the Prussian cannon
thundered on our left; but so desperate was the
French resistance, they made but little progress: the
dark columns of the Guard had now commenced the as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>cent,
and the artillery ceased their fire as the bayonets of
the grenadiers showed themselves upon the slope. Then
began that tremendous cheer from right to left of our
line which those who heard never can forget. It was the
impatient, long-restrained burst of unslaked vengeance.
With the instinct which valor teaches, they knew the
hour of trial was come; and that wild cry flew from rank
to rank, echoing from the blood-stained walls of Hougoumont
to the far-off valley of La Papelotte. "They
come! they come!" was the cry; and the shout of "<i>Vive
l'Empereur!</i>" mingled with the outburst of the British
line.</p>

<p>Under an overwhelming shower of grape, to which
succeeded a charge of cavalry of the Imperial Guard,
the head of Ney's column fired its volley and advanced
with the bayonet. The British artillery now opened at
half range, and although the plunging fire scathed and
devastated the dark ranks of the Guards, on they came,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Ney
himself, on foot, at their head. Twice the leading
division of that gallant column turned completely round,
as the withering fire wasted and consumed them; but
they were resolved to win.</p>

<p>Already they had gained the crest of the hill, and the
first line of the British were falling back before them.
The artillery closes up; the flanking fire from the guns
upon the road opens upon them; the head of their
column breaks like a shell; the Duke seizes the moment,
and advances on foot towards the ridge.</p>

<p>"Up, Guards, and at them!" he cried.</p>

<p>The hour of triumph and vengeance had arrived. In
a moment the Guards were on their feet; one volley was
poured in; the bayonets were brought to the charge;
they closed upon the enemy: then was seen the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
dreadful struggle that the history of all war can present.
Furious with long restrained passion, the guards rushed
upon the leading divisions; the seventy-first, and ninety-fifth,
and twenty-sixth overlapped them on the flanks.
Their generals fell thickly on every side; Michel, Jamier,
and Mallet are killed: Friant lies wounded upon the
ground; Ney, his dress pierced and ragged with balls,
shouts still to advance; but the leading files waver;
they fall back; the supporting divisions thicken; confusion,
panic succeeds; the British press down; the cavalry
come galloping up to their assistance; and, at last, pell-mell,
overwhelmed and beaten, the French fall back upon
the Old Guard. This was the decisive moment of the
day;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the Duke closed his glass, as he said:</p>

<p>"The field is won. Order the whole line to advance."</p>

<p>On they came, four deep, and poured like a torrent
from the height.</p>

<p>"Let the Life Guards charge them," said the Duke;
but every aid-de-camp on his staff was wounded, and I
myself brought the order to Lord Uxbridge.</p>

<p>Lord Uxbridge had already anticipated his orders, and
bore down with four regiments of heavy cavalry upon
the French centre. The Prussian artillery thundered
upon their flank, and at their rear. The British bayonet
was in their front; while a panic fear spread through their
ranks, and the cry "<i>Sauve qui peut!</i>" resounded on all
sides. In vain Ney, the bravest of the brave; in vain
Soult, Bertrand, Gourgaud, and Labedoy<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>re, burst from
the broken disorganized mass, and called on them to
stand fast. A battalion of the Old Guard, with Cambronne
at their head, alone obeyed the summons: forming
into square, they stood between the pursuers and
their prey, offering themselves a sacrifice to the tarnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>ed
honor of their arms: to the order to surrender, they
answered with a cry of defiance; and, as our cavalry,
flushed and elated with victory, rode round their bristling
ranks, no quailing look, no craven spirit was there. The
Emperor himself endeavored to repair the disaster; he
rode with lightening speed hither and thither, commanding,
ordering, nay imploring too; but already the night
was falling, the confusion became each moment more
inextricable, and the effort was a fruitless one. A regiment
of the Guards, and two batteries were in reserve
behind Planchenoit; he threw them rapidly into position;
but the overwhelming impulse of flight drove the mass
upon them, and they were carried away upon the torrent
of the beaten army. No sooner did the Emperor see
this his last hope desert him, than he dismounted from
his horse, and, drawing his sword, threw himself into a
square, which the first regiment of chasseurs of the Old
Guard had formed with a remnant of the battalion; Jerome
followed him, as he called out:</p>

<p>"You are right, brother: here should perish all who
bear the name of Buonaparte."</p>

<p>The same moment the Prussian light artillery rend the
ranks asunder, and the cavalry charge down upon the
scattered fragments. A few of his staff, who never left
him, place the Emperor upon a horse,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and fly.</p>

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And the peril chill'd back every thought of the prize.</span><br />
And thrice spoke the monarch: "The cup to win,<br />

<p>And all as before heard in silence the king,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Till a youth with an aspect unfearing but gentle,</span><br />
'Mid the tremulous squires stepp'd out from the ring,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle;</span><br />
And the murmuring crowd, as they parted asunder,<br />
On the stately boy cast their looks of wonder.</p>

And it never <i>will</i> rest, nor from travail be free,<br />
Like a sea that is laboring the birth of a sea.</p>

<p>Yet, at length, comes a lull o'er the mighty commotion,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And dark through the whiteness, and still through the swell,</span><br />
The whirlpool cleaves downward and downward in ocean<br />

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Callista</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Juba's</span> finger was directed to a spot where, amid the
thick foliage, the gleam of a pool or of a marsh was visible.
The various waters round about, issuing from the
gravel, or drained from the nightly damps, had run into
a hollow, filled with the decaying vegetation of former
years. Its banks were bordered with a deep, broad layer
of mud, a transition substance between the rich vegetable
matter which it once had been, and the multitudinous
world of insect life which it was becoming. A cloud or
mist at this time was hanging over it, high in air. A harsh
and shrill sound, a whizzing or a chirping, proceeded from
that cloud to the ear of the attentive listener. What
these indications portended was plain....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>The plague of locusts, one of the most awful visitations
to which the countries included in the Roman empire
were exposed, extended from the Atlantic to Ethiopia,
from Arabia to India, and from the Nile and Red Sea
to Greece and the north of Asia Minor. Instances are
recorded in history of clouds of the devastating insect
crossing the Black Sea to Poland, and the Mediterranean
to Lombardy. It is as numerous in its species as it is
wide in its range of territory. Brood follows brood, with
a sort of family likeness, yet with distinct attributes.
It wakens into existence and activity as early as the
month of March; but instances are not wanting, as in
our present history, of its appearance as late as June.
Even one flight comprises myriads upon myriads passing
imagination, to which the drops of rain or the sands
of the sea are the only fit comparison; and hence it is
almost a proverbial mode of expression in the East, by
way of describing a vast invading army, to liken it to the
locusts. So dense are they, when upon the wing, that it
is no exaggeration to say that they hide the sun, from
which circumstance indeed their name in Arabic is derived.
And so ubiquitous are they when they have
alighted on the earth, that they simply cover or clothe
its surface.</p>

<p>This last characteristic is stated in the sacred account
of the plagues of Egypt, where their faculty of devastation
is also mentioned. The corrupting fly and the
bruising and prostrating hail preceded them in that series
of visitations, but <i>they</i> came to do the work of ruin more
thoroughly. For not only the crops and fruits, but the
foliage of the forest itself, nay, the small twigs and the
bark of the trees are the victims of their curious and
energetic rapacity. They have been known even to gnaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the door-posts of the houses. Nor do they execute their
task in so slovenly a way, that, as they have succeeded
other plagues, so they may have successors themselves.
They take pains to spoil what they leave. Like the
Harpies, they smear every thing that they touch with a
miserable slime, which has the effect of a virus in corroding,
or as some say, in scorching and burning. And then,
perhaps, as if all this were little, when they can do nothing
else, they die; as if out of sheer malevolence to man, for
the poisonous elements of their nature are then let loose
and dispersed abroad, and create a pestilence; and they
manage to destroy many more by their death than in
their life.</p>

<p>Such are the locusts. And now they are rushing upon
a considerable tract of that beautiful region of which we
have spoken with such admiration. The swarm to which
Juba pointed grew and grew till it became a compact
body, as much as a furlong square; yet it was but the
vanguard of a series of similar hosts, formed one after
another out of the hot mould or sand, rising into the air
like clouds, enlarging into a dusky canopy, and then discharged
against the fruitful plain. At length the huge
innumerous mass was put into motion, and began its
career, darkening the face of day. As became an instrument
of divine power, it seemed to have no volition of
its own; it was set off, it drifted, with the wind, and thus
made northwards, straight for Sicca. Thus they advanced,
host after host, for a time wafted on the air, and
gradually declining to the earth, while fresh broods were
carried over the first, and neared the earth, after a longer
flight, in their turn. For twelve miles did they extend
from front to rear, and their whizzing and hissing could
be heard for six miles on every side of them. The bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
sun, though hidden by them, illumined their bodies, and
was reflected from their quivering wings; and as they
heavily fell earthward, they seemed like the innumerable
flakes of a yellow-colored snow. And like snow did
they descend, a living carpet, or rather pall, upon fields,
crops, gardens, copses, groves, orchards, vineyards, olive
woods, orangeries, palm plantations, and the deep forests,
sparing nothing within their reach, and where there was
nothing to devour, lying helpless in drifts, or crawling
forward obstinately, as they best might, with the hope
of prey. They could spare their hundred thousand soldiers
twice or thrice over, and not miss them; their
masses filled the bottoms of the ravines and hollow ways,
impeding the traveller as he rode forward on his journey
and trampled by thousands under his horse-hoofs. In
vain was all this overthrow and waste by the roadside,
in vain their loss in river, pool, and watercourse. The
poor peasants hastily dug pits and trenches as their
enemy came on; in vain they filled them from the wells
or with lighted stubble. Heavily and thickly did the
locusts fall; they were lavish of their lives; they choked
the flame and the water, which destroyed them the while,
and the vast living hostile armament still moved on.</p>

<p>They moved right on like soldiers in their ranks, stopping
at nothing, and straggling for nothing; they carried
a broad furrow or wheal all across the country, black and
loathsome, while it was as green and smiling on each side
of them and in front, as it had been before they came.
Before them, in the language of prophets, was a paradise,
and behind them a desert. They are daunted by nothing
they surmount walls and hedges, and enter enclosed gardens
or inhabited houses. A rare and experimental
vineyard has been planted in a sheltered grove. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
high winds of Africa will not commonly allow the light
trellice or the slim pole; but here the lofty poplar of
Campania has been possible, on which the vine plant
mounts so many yards into the air, that the poor grape-gatherers
bargain for a funeral pile and a tomb as one of
the conditions of their engagement. The locusts have
done what the winds and lightning could not do, and the
whole promise of the vintage, leaves and all, is gone, and
the slender stems are left bare. There is another yard,
less uncommon, but still tended with more than common
care; each plant is kept within due bounds by a circular
trench round it, and by upright canes on which it is to
trail; in an hour the solicitude and long toil of the vine-dresser
are lost, and his pride humbled. There is a
smiling farm; another sort of vine, of remarkable character,
is found against the farmhouse. This vine springs
from one root, and has clothed and matted with its many
branches the four walls. The whole of it is covered thick
with long clusters, which another month will ripen. On
every grape and leaf there is a locust. Into the dry
caves and pits, carefully strewed with straw, the harvest-men
have (safely, as they thought just now) been lodging
the far-famed African wheat. One grain or root shoots
up into ten, twenty, fifty, eighty, nay, three or four hundred
stalks: sometimes the stalks have two ears apiece,
and these shoot into a number of lesser ones. These
stores are intended for the Roman populace, but the
locusts have been beforehand with them. The small
patches of ground belonging to the poor peasants up and
down the country, for raising the turnips, garlic, barley,
water-melons, on which they live, are the prey of these
glutton invaders as much as the choicest vines and olives.
Nor have they any reverence for the villa of the civic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
decurion or the Roman official. The neatly arranged
kitchen garden, with its cherries, plums, peaches, and
apricots, is a waste; as the slaves sit round, in the kitchen
in the first court, at their coarse evening meal, the
room is filled with the invading force, and news comes
to them that the enemy has fallen upon the apples and
pears in the basement, and is at the same time plundering
and sacking the preserves of quince and pomegranate,
and revelling in the jars of precious oil of Cyprus and
Mendes in the store-rooms.</p>

<p>They come up to the walls of Sicca, and are flung
against them into the ditch. Not a moment's hesitation
or delay; they recover their footing, they climb up the
wood or stucco, they surmount the parapet, or they have
entered in at the windows, filling the apartments, and the
most private and luxurious chambers, not one or two,
like stragglers at forage or rioters after a victory, but in
order of battle, and with the array of an army. Choice
plants or flowers about the <i>impluvia</i> and <i>xysti</i>, for ornament
or refreshment, myrtles, oranges, pomegranates,
the rose and the carnation, have disappeared. They dim
the bright marbles of the walls and the gilding of the
ceilings. They enter the triclinium in the midst of the
banquet; they crawl over the viands and spoil what they
do not devour. Unrelaxed by success and by enjoyment,
onward they go; a secret mysterious instinct keeps them
together, as if they had a king over them. They move
along the floor in so strange an order that they seem to
be a tessellated pavement themselves, and to be the artificial
embellishment of the place; so true are their lines,
and so perfect is the pattern they describe. Onward
they go, to the market, to the temple sacrifices, to the
bakers' stores, to the cookshops, to the confectioners, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the druggists; nothing comes amiss to them; wherever
man has aught to eat or drink, there are they, reckless of
death, strong of appetite, certain of conquest....</p>

<p>Another and a still worse calamity. The invaders, as
we have already hinted, could be more terrible still in
their overthrow than in their ravages. The inhabitants
of the country had attempted, where they could, to destroy
them by fire and water. It would seem as if the
malignant animals had resolved that the sufferers should
have the benefit of this policy to the full; for they had
not got more than twenty miles beyond Sicca when they
suddenly sickened and died. When they thus had done
all the mischief they could by their living, when they thus
had made their foul maws the grave of every living thing,
next they died themselves, and made the desolated land
their own grave. They took from it its hundred forms
and varieties of beautiful life, and left it their own fetid
and poisonous carcases in payment. It was a sudden
catastrophe; they seemed making for the Mediterranean,
as if, like other great conquerors, they had other worlds
to subdue beyond it; but, whether they were overgorged,
or struck by some atmospheric change, or that their time
was come and they paid the debt of nature, so it was
that suddenly they fell, and their glory came to nought,
and all was vanity to them as to others, and "their stench
rose up, and their corruption rose up, because they had
done proudly."</p>

<p>The hideous swarms lay dead in the moist steaming
underwoods, in the green swamps, in the sheltered valleys,
in the ditches and furrows of the fields, amid the
monuments of their own prowess, the ruined crops and
the dishonored vineyards. A poisonous element, issuing
from their remains, mingled with the atmosphere, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
corrupted it. The dismayed peasant found that a plague
had begun; a new visitation, not confined to the territory
which the enemy had made its own, but extending
far and wide, as the atmosphere extends, in all directions.
Their daily toil, no longer claimed by the fruits
of the earth, which have ceased to exist, is now devoted
to the object of ridding themselves of the deadly legacy
which they have received in their stead. In vain; it is
their last toil; they are digging pits, they are raising
piles, for their own corpses, as well as for the bodies of
their enemies. Invader and victim lie in the same grave,
burn in the same heap; they sicken while they work, and
the pestilence spreads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was scarce a score of persons in the Cathedral
beside the Dean and some of his clergy, and the choristers,
young and old, that performed the beautiful evening
prayer. But Mr. Tusher was one of the officiants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
read from the eagle in an authoritative voice, and a great
black periwig; and in the stalls, still in her black widow's
hood, sat Esmond's dear mistress, her son by her side,
very much grown, and indeed a noble-looking youth, with
his mother's eyes, and his father's curling brown hair,
that fell over his <i>point de Venise</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a pretty picture such
as Vandyke might have painted. Mons. Rigaud's portrait
of my Lord Viscount, done at Paris afterwards, gives
but a French version of his manly, frank English face.
When he looked up there were two sapphire beams out
of his eyes such as no painter's palette has the color to
match, I think. On this day there was not much chance
of seeing that particular beauty of my young lord's countenance;
for the truth is, he kept his eyes shut for the
most part, and, the anthem being rather long, was asleep.</p>

<p>But the music ceasing, my lord woke up, looking about
him, and his eyes lighting on Mr. Esmond, who was sitting
opposite him, gazing with no small tenderness and
melancholy upon two persons who had so much of his
heart for so many years, Lord Castlewood, with a start;
pulled at his mother's sleeve (her face had scarce been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
lifted from her book), and said, "Look, mother!" so loud,
that Esmond could hear on the other side of the church,
and the old Dean on his throned stall. Lady Castlewood
looked for an instant as her son bade her, and held
up a warning finger to Frank; Esmond felt his whole face
flush, and his heart throbbing, as that dear lady beheld
him once more. The rest of the prayers were speedily
over; Mr. Esmond did not hear them; nor did his mistress,
very likely, whose hood went more closely over her
face, and who never lifted her head again until the service
was over, the blessing given, and Mr. Dean, and his
procession of ecclesiastics, out of the inner chapel.</p>

<p>Young Castlewood came clambering over the stalls
before the clergy were fairly gone, and running up to
Esmond, eagerly embraced him. "My dear, dearest old
Harry!" he said, "are you come back? Have you been
to the wars? You'll take me with you when you go
again? Why didn't you write to us? Come to mother."</p>

<p>Mr. Esmond could hardly say more than a "God bless
you, my boy," for his heart was very full and grateful at
all this tenderness on the lad's part; and he was as much
moved at seeing Frank as he was fearful about that other
interview which was now to take place: for he knew not
if the widow would reject him as she had done so cruelly
a year ago.</p>

<p>"It was kind of you to come back to us, Henry," Lady
Esmond said. "I thought you might come."</p>

<p>"We read of the fleet coming to Portsmouth. Why
did you not come from Portsmouth?" Frank asked, or
my Lord Viscount, as he now must be called.</p>

<p>Esmond had thought of that too. He would have
given one of his eyes so that he might see his dear friends
again once more; but believing that his mistress had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
forbidden him her house, he had obeyed her, and remained
at a distance.</p>

<p>"You had but to ask, and you knew I would be here,"
he said.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, her little fair hand: there was
only her marriage ring on it. The quarrel was all over.
The year of grief and estrangement was passed. They
never had been separated. His mistress had never been
out of his mind all that time. No, not once. No, not in
the prison; nor in the camp; nor on shore before the
enemy; nor at sea under the stars of solemn midnight;
nor as he watched the glorious rising of the dawn: not
even at the table, where he sat carousing with friends, or
at the theatre yonder, where he tried to fancy that other
eyes were brighter than hers. Brighter eyes there
might be, and faces more beautiful, but none so dear<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no
voice so sweet as that of his beloved mistress, who had
been sister, mother, goddess to him during his youth<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>goddess
now no more, for he knew of her weaknesses;
and by thought, by suffering, and that experience it
brings, was older now than she; but more fondly cherished
as woman perhaps than ever she had been adored
as divinity. What is it? Where lies it? the secret which
makes one little hand the dearest of all? Who ever can
unriddle that mystery? Here she was, her son by his
side, his dear boy. Here she was, weeping and happy.
She took his hand in both hers; he felt her tears. It
was a rapture of reconciliation....</p>

<p>"And Harry's coming home to supper. Huzzay!
huzzay!" cries my lord. "Mother, I shall run home and
bid Beatrix put her ribbons on. Beatrix is a maid of
honor, Harry. Such a fine set-up minx!"</p>

<p>"Your heart was never in the Church, Harry," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
widow said, in her sweet low tone, as they walked away
together. (Now, it seemed they had never been parted,
and again, as if they had been ages asunder.) "I always
thought you had no vocation that way; and that 'twas a
pity to shut you out from the world. You would but
have pined and chafed at Castlewood: and 'tis better
you should make a name for yourself. I often said so to
my dear lord. How he loved you! 'Twas my lord that
made you stay with us."</p>

<p>"I asked no better than to stay near you always," said
Mr. Esmond.</p>

<p>"But to go was best, Harry. When the world cannot
give peace, you will know where to find it; but one of
your strong imagination and eager desires must try the
world first before he tires of it. 'Twas not to be thought
of, or if it once was, it was only by my selfishness, that
you should remain as chaplain to a country gentleman
and tutor to a little boy. You are of the blood of the
Esmonds, kinsman; and that was always wild in youth.
Look at Francis. He is but fifteen, and I scarce can keep
him in my nest. His talk is all of war and pleasure, and
he longs to serve in the next campaign. Perhaps he and
the young Lord Churchill shall go the next. Lord Marlborough
has been good to us. You know how kind they
were in my misfortune. And so was your<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>your father's
widow. No one knows how good the world is, till grief
comes to try us. 'Tis through my Lady Marlborough's
goodness that Beatrix hath her place at Court; and Frank
is under my Lord Chamberlain. And the dowager lady,
your father's widow, has promised to provide for you<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>has
she not?"</p>

<p>Esmond said, "Yes. As far as present favor went,
Lady Castlewood was very good to him. And should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
her mind change," he added gaily, "as ladies' minds will,
I am strong enough to bear my own burden, and make
my way somehow. Not by the sword very likely.
Thousands have a better genius for that than I, but there
are many ways in which a young man of good parts and
education can get on in the world; and I am pretty sure,
one way or other, of promotion!" Indeed, he had found
patrons already in the army, and amongst persons very
able to serve him, too; and told his mistress of the flattering
aspect of fortune. They walked as though they had
never been parted, slowly, with the grey twilight closing
round them.</p>

<p>"And now we are drawing near to home," she continued,
"I knew you would come, Harry, if<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if it was
but to forgive me for having spoken unjustly to you
after that horrid<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>horrid misfortune. I was half frantic
with grief then when I saw you. And I know now<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they
have told me. That wretch, whose name I can never
mention, even has said it: how you tried to avert the
quarrel, and would have taken it on yourself, my poor
child: but it was God's will that I should be punished,
and that my dear lord should fall."</p>

<p>"He gave me his blessing on his death-bed," Esmond
said. "Thank God for that legacy!"</p>

<p>"Amen, amen! dear Henry," said the lady, pressing
his arm. "I knew it. Mr. Atterbury, of St. Bride's, who
was called to him, told me so. And I thanked God, too,
and in my prayers ever since remembered it."</p>

<p>"You had spared me many a bitter night, had you told
me sooner," Mr. Esmond said.</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it," she answered, in a tone of such
sweet humility, as made Esmond repent that he should
ever have dared to reproach her. "I know how wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
my heart has been; and I have suffered too, my dear.
But I knew you would come back<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I own that. And
to-day, Henry, in the anthem, when they sang it, 'When
the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, we were like
them that dream,' I thought yes, like them that dream<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>them
that dream. And then it went, 'They that sow
in tears shall reap in joy; and he that goeth forth and
weepeth, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing
his sheaves with him;' I looked up from the book
and saw you. I was not surprised when I saw you. I
knew you would come, my dear, and saw the gold sunshine
round your head."</p>

<p>She smiled an almost wild smile as she looked up at
him. The moon was up by this time, glittering keen in
the frosty sky. He could see, for the first time now
clearly, her sweet careworn face.</p>

<p>"Do you know what day it is?" she continued. "It
is the 29th day of December<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it is your birthday! But
last year we did not drink it<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no, no. My lord was cold,
and my Harry was likely to die: and my brain was in a
fever; and we had no wine. But now<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now you are
come again, bringing your sheaves with you, my dear."
She burst into a wild flood of weeping as she spoke; she
laughed and sobbed on the young man's heart, crying out
wildly, "bringing your sheaves with you<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>your sheaves
with you!"</p>

<p>As he had sometimes felt, gazing up from the deck at
midnight into the boundless starlit depths overhead, in a
rapture of devout wonder at that endless brightness and
beauty<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in some such a way now, the depth of this pure
devotion quite smote upon him, and filled his heart with
thanksgiving. Gracious God, who was he, weak and
friendless creature, that such a love should be poured out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
upon him? Not in vain<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not in vain has he lived<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>hard
and thankless should he be to think so<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that has such a
treasure given him. What is ambition compared to that,
but selfish vanity? To be rich, to be famous? What
do these profit a year hence, when other names sound
louder than yours, when you lie hidden away under the
ground, along with idle titles engraven on your coffin?
But only true love lives after you<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>follows your memory
with secret blessing<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>or precedes you, and intercedes for
you. <i>Non omnis moriar</i><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if dying, I yet live in a tender
heart or two; nor am lost and hopeless living, if a sainted
departed soul still loves and prays for me.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_N_51" id="Footnote_N_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_N_51"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> <i>From "The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., a Colonel in the Service of
Her Majesty Queen Anne. Written by himself."</i></p>

<p class="footnote">The late Lord Castlewood had been killed in a duel, and young Esmond,
who had lived in his house as a dependant (reputed to have been illegitimately
related to a former Viscount of Castlewood), devotedly attending him at his
death-bed, received from the dying man confession and proof that he, the supposed
obscure orphan, was the true inheritor, and in justice ought to have been
the possessor, of the Castlewood titles and estates. But Esmond, for the love he
had borne his patron, and from devotion to Lady Castlewood, who had much
befriended him, immediately destroyed the proofs which were given him of his
honorable parentage, and ever afterwards kept his claim a secret. After the
duel, while Esmond was in prison, Lady Castlewood visited him, and in the
wildness of her grief for her murdered husband, reproached her loyal kinsman
for not having saved her lord's life, or avenged his death. In the estrangement
which these reproaches occasioned, Esmond sought his fortune abroad in war;
but subsequently, desiring to learn of the welfare of his mistress and her family,
whose happiness he prized more than his own, he returned to England, and
went to Winchester, near which was Walcote, Lady Castlewood's home. The
family were attending service in the cathedral, and there the reconciliation took
place.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Esmond had formerly been promised the living of Walcote, but the
vacancy occurring while the estrangement continued. Lady Castlewood had
given it to one Mr. Tusher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rhine is running deep and red, the island lies before,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
"Now is there one of all the host will dare to venture o'er?<br />
For not alone the river's sweep might make a brave man quail;<br />
The foe are on the further side, their shot comes fast as hail.<br />
God help us, if the middle isle we may not hope to win!<br />
Now is there any of the host will dare to venture in?"</p>

<p>"The ford is deep, the banks are steep, the island-shore lies<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">wide;</span><br />
Nor man nor horse could stem its force, or reach the further side.<br />
See there! amidst the willow-boughs the serried bayonets gleam;<br />
They've flung their bridge,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they've won the isle; the foe have<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">cross'd the stream!</span><br />
Their volley flashes sharp and strong,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>by all the saints! I trow<br />
There never yet was soldier born could force that passage now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
So spoke the bold French Mareschal with him who led the van,<br />
Whilst rough and red before their view the turbid river ran.<br />
Nor bridge nor boat had they to cross the wild and swollen<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Rhine,</span><br />
And thundering on the other bank far stretch'd the German line.<br />
Hard by there stood a swarthy man was leaning on his sword,<br />
And a sadden'd smile lit up his face as he heard the Captain's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">word.</span><br />
"I've seen a wilder stream ere now than that which rushes there;<br />
I've stemm'd a heavier torrent yet and never thought to dare.<br />
If German steel be sharp and keen, is ours not strong and true?<br />
There may be danger in the deed, but there is honor too."</p>

<p>The old lord in his saddle turn'd, and hastily he said,<br />
"Hath bold Duguesclin's fiery heart awaken'd from the dead?<br />
Thou art the leader of the Scots,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now well and sure I know,<br />
That gentle blood in dangerous hour ne'er yet ran cold nor<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">slow,</span><br />
And I have seen ye in the fight do all that mortal may:<br />
If honor is the boon ye seek, it may be won this day,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
The prize is in the middle isle, there lies the adventurous way,<br />
And armies twain are on the plain, the daring deed to see,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Now ask thy gallant company if they will follow thee!"</p>

<p>Right gladsome look'd the Captain then, and nothing did he say,<br />
But he turn'd him to his little band,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>O, few, I ween, were they!<br />
The relics of the bravest force that ever fought in fray.<br />
No one of all that company but bore a gentle name,<br />
Not one whose fathers had not stood in Scotland's fields of fame.<br />
All they had march'd with great Dundee to where he fought and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">fell,</span><br />
And in the deadly battle-strife had venged their leader well:<br />
And they had bent the knee to earth when every eye was dim,<br />
As o'er their hero's buried corpse they sang the funeral hymn;<br />
And they had trod the Pass once more, and stoop'd on either<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">side</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>To pluck the heather from the spot where he had dropp'd and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">died;</span><br />
And they had bound it next their hearts, and ta'en a last farewell<br />
Of Scottish earth and Scottish sky, where Scotland's glory fell.<br />
Then went they forth to foreign lands like bent and broken men,<br />
Who leave their dearest hope behind, and may not turn again.</p>

<p>"The stream," he said, "is broad and deep, and stubborn is<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the foe,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Yon island-strength is guarded well,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>say, brothers, will ye go?<br />
From home and kin for many a year our steps have wander'd<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">wide,</span><br />
And never may our bones be laid our fathers' graves beside.<br />
No children have we to lament, no wives to wail our fall;<br />
The traitor's and the spoiler's hand have reft our hearths of all.<br />
But we have hearts, and we have arms, as strong to will and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">dare</span><br />
As when our ancient banners flew within the northern air.<br />
Come, brothers! let me name a spell shall rouse your souls<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">again,</span><br />
And send the old blood bounding free through pulse and heart<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and vein.</span><br />
Call back the days of bygone years,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>be young and strong once<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">more;</span><br />
Think yonder stream, so stark and red, is one we've cross'd<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">before.</span><br />
Rise, hill and glen! rise, crag and wood! rise up on either hand,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Again upon the Garry's banks, on Scottish soil we stand!<br />
Again I see the tartans wave, again the trumpets ring;<br />
Again I hear our leader's call: 'Upon them for the King!'<br />
Stay'd we behind that glorious day for roaring flood or linn?<br />
The soul of Gr<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>me is with us still,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>now, brothers, will ye in?"</p>

<p>No stay,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no pause. With one accord, they grasp'd each other's<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hand,</span><br />
Then plunged into the angry flood, that bold and dauntless band.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>High flew the spray above their heads, yet onward still they<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">bore,</span><br />
Midst cheer, and shout, and answering yell, and shot, and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">cannon-roar,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
"Now, by the Holy Cross! I swear, since earth and sea began,<br />
Was never such a daring deed essay'd by mortal man!"</p>

<p>Thick blew the smoke across the stream, and faster flash'd the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">flame:</span><br />
The water plash'd in hissing jets as ball and bullet came.<br />
Yet onwards push'd the Cavaliers all stern and undismay'd,<br />
With thousand arm<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d foes before, and none behind to aid.<br />
Once, as they near'd the middle stream, so strong the torrent<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">swept,</span><br />
That scarce that long and living wall their dangerous footing<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">kept.</span><br />
Then rose a warning cry behind, a joyous shout before:<br />
"The current's strong,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the way is long,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they'll never reach<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the shore!</span><br />
See, see! they stagger in the midst, they waver in their line!<br />
Fire on the madmen! break their ranks, and whelm them in<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the Rhine!"</span></p>

<p>Have you seen the tall trees swaying when the blast is sounding<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">shrill,</span><br />
And the whirlwind reels in fury down the gorges of the hill?<br />
How they toss their mighty branches struggling with the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;"> shock;</span><br />
How they keep their place of vantage, cleaving firmly to the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">rock?</span><br />
Even so the Scottish warriors held their own against the river;<br />
Though the water flash'd around them, not an eye was seen to<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">quiver;</span><br />
Though the shot flew sharp and deadly, not a man relax'd his<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hold;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span><br />
For their hearts were big and thrilling with the mighty thoughts<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">of old.</span><br />
One word was spoke among them, and through the ranks it<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">spread,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
"Remember our dead Claverhouse!" was all the Captain said.<br />
Then, sternly bending forward, they wrestled on a while,<br />
Until they clear'd the heavy stream, then rush'd towards the isle.</p>

<p>The German heart is stout and true, the German arm is strong;<br />
The German foot goes seldom back where arm<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d foemen throng.<br />
But never had they faced in field so stern a charge before,<br />
And never had they felt the sweep of Scotland's broad claymore.<br />
Not fiercer pours the avalanche adown the steep incline,<br />
That rises o'er the parent-springs of rough and rapid Rhine,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Scarce swifter shoots the bolt from heaven than came the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Scottish band</span><br />
Right up against the guarded trench, and o'er it sword in hand.<br />
In vain their leaders forward press,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they meet the deadly<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">brand!</span></p>

<p>O lonely island of the Rhine,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>where seed was never sown,<br />
What harvest lay upon thy sands, by those strong reapers thrown?<br />
What saw the winter moon that night, as, struggling through<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">the rain,</span><br />
She pour'd a wan and fitful light on marsh, and stream, and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">plain?</span><br />
A dreary spot with corpses strewn, and bayonets glistening<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">round;</span><br />
A broken bridge, a stranded boat, a bare and batter'd mound;<br />
And one huge watch-fire's kindled pile, that sent its quivering<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">glare</span><br />
To tell the leaders of the host the conquering Scots were there!</p>

<p>And did they twine the laurel-wreath, for those who fought so<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">well?</span><br />
And did they honor those who liv'd, and weep for those who<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">fell?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>What meed of thanks was given to them let ag<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d annals tell.<br />
Why should they bring the laurel-wreath,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>why crown the cup<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">with wine?</span><br />
It was not Frenchmen's blood that flow'd so freely on the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">Rhine,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
A stranger band of beggar'd men had done the venturous deed:<br />
The glory was to France alone, the danger was their meed.<br />
And what cared they for idle thanks from foreign prince and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">peer?</span><br />
What virtue had such honey'd words the exiled heart to cheer?<br />
What matter'd it that men should vaunt and loud and fondly<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">swear,</span><br />
That higher feat of chivalry was never wrought elsewhere?<br />
They bore within their breasts the grief that fame can never<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">heal,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
The deep, unutterable woe which none save exiles feel.<br />
Their hearts were yearning for the land they ne'er might see<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">again,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />

For those who haply lay at rest beyond the distant sea,<br />

<p>Long years went by. The lonely isle in Rhine's tempestuous<br />

The peasant, as he sees the stream in winter rolling by,<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">Earl of Beaconsfield</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1805-1881.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Young Duke</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young Duke had accepted the invitation of the
Baron de Berghem for to-morrow, and accordingly, himself,
Lords Castlefort and Dice, and Temple Grace assembled
in Brunswick Terrace at the usual hour. The
dinner was studiously plain, and very little wine was
drunk; yet everything was perfect. Tom Cogit stepped
in to carve in his usual silent manner. He always came
in and went out of a room without anyone observing
him. He winked familiarly to Temple Grace, but scarcely
presumed to bow to the Duke. He was very busy about
the wine, and dressed the wild fowl in a manner quite
unparalleled. He took particular care to send a most
perfect portion to the young Duke, and he did this, as he
paid all attentions to influential strangers, with the most
marked consciousness of the sufferance which permitted
his presence: never addressing his Grace, but audibly
whispering to the servant, "Take this to the Duke"; or
asking the attendant, "whether his Grace would try the
Hermitage?"</p>

<p>After dinner, with the exception of Cogit, who was
busied in compounding some wonderful liquid for the
future refreshment, they sat down to <ins class="translit" title="e acute"><i>&#233;</i></ins><i>cart</i><ins class="translit" title="e acute"><i>&#233;</i></ins>. Without
having exchanged a word upon the subject, there seemed
a general understanding among all the parties that to-night
was to be a pitched battle, and they began at once,
briskly. Yet, in spite of their universal determination,
midnight arrived without anything decisive. Another
hour passed over, and then Tom Cogit kept touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Baron's elbow and whispering in a voice which everybody
could understand. All this meant that supper was ready.
It was brought into the room.</p>

<p>Gaming has one advantage, it gives you an appetite;
that is to say, so long as you have a chance remaining.
The Duke had thousands; for at present his resources
were unimpared, and he was exhausted by the constant
attention and anxiety of five hours. He passed over the
delicacies and went to the side-table, and began cutting
himself some cold roast beef. Tom Cogit ran up, not to
his Grace, but to the Baron, to announce the shocking
fact that the Duke of St. James was enduring great
trouble; and then the Baron asked his Grace to permit
Mr. Cogit to serve him. Our hero devoured: we use the
word advisedly, as fools say in the House of Commons:
he devoured the roast beef, and rejecting the Hermitage
with disgust, asked for porter.</p>

<p>They set to again fresh as eagles. At six o'clock
accounts were so complicated that they stopped to
make up their books. Each played with his memoranda
and pencil at his side. Nothing fatal had yet happened.
The Duke owed Lord Dice about five thousand
pounds, and Temple Grace owed him as many hundreds.
Lord Castlefort also was his debtor to the tune
of seven hundred and fifty, and the Baron was in his
books, but slightly. Every half-hour they had a new
pack of cards, and threw the used one on the floor. All
this time Tom Cogit did nothing but snuff the candles,
stir the fire, bring them a new pack, and occasionally
make a tumbler for them. At eight o'clock the Duke's
situation was worsened. The run was greatly against
him, and perhaps his losses were doubled. He pulled up
again the next hour or two; but nevertheless, at ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
o'clock, owed every one something. No one offered to
give over; and everyone, perhaps, felt that his object was
not obtained. They made their toilets and went down-stairs
to breakfast. In the meantime the shutters were
opened, the room aired, and in less than an hour they
were at it again.</p>

<p>They played till dinner-time without intermission; and
though the Duke made some desperate efforts, and some
successful ones, his losses were, nevertheless, trebled.
Yet he ate an excellent dinner and was not at all depressed;
because the more he lost, the more his courage
and his resources seemed to expand. At first he had
limited himself to ten thousand; after breakfast it was
to have been twenty thousand; then thirty thousand was
the ultimatum; and now he dismissed all thoughts of
limits from his mind, and was determined to risk or gain
everything.</p>

<p>At midnight, he had lost forty-eight thousand pounds.
Affairs now began to be serious. His supper was not so
hearty. While the rest were eating, he walked about
the room, and began to limit his ambition to recovery,
and not to gain. When you play to win back, the fun is
over: there is nothing to recompense you for your bodily
tortures and your degraded feelings; and the very best
result that can happen, while it has no charms, seems to
your cowed mind impossible.</p>

<p>On they played, and the Duke lost more. His mind
was jaded. He floundered, he made desperate efforts,
but plunged deeper in the slough. Feeling that, to regain
his ground, each card must tell, he acted on each as
if it must win, and the consequences of this insanity (for
a gamester at such a crisis is really insane) were, that his
losses were prodigious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>Another morning came, and there they sat, ankle-deep
in cards. No attempt at breakfast now, no affectation
of making a toilet or airing the room. The atmosphere
was hot, to be sure, but it well became such a Hell.
There they sat, in total, in positive forgetfulness of everything
but the hot game they were hunting down. There
was not a man in the room, except Tom Cogit, who could
have told you the name of the town in which they were
living. There they sat, almost breathless, watching every
turn with the fell look in their cannibal eyes which showed
their total inability to sympathize with their fellow-beings.
All forms of society had been long forgotten.
There was no snuff-box handed about now, for courtesy,
admiration, or a pinch; no affectation of occasionally
making a remark upon any other topic but the all-engrossing
one. Lord Castlefort rested with his arms on
the table: a false tooth had got unhinged. His Lordship,
who, at any other time, would have been most annoyed,
coolly put it in his pocket. His cheeks had fallen,
and he looked twenty years older. Lord Dice had torn
off his cravat, and his hair hung down over his callous,
bloodless cheeks, straight as silk. Temple Grace looked
as if he were blighted by lightning; and his deep blue
eyes gleamed like a hyena's. The Baron was least
changed. Tom Cogit, who smelt that the crisis was at
hand, was as quiet as a bribed rat.</p>

<p>On they played till six o'clock in the evening, and then
they agreed to desist till after dinner. Lord Dice threw
himself on a sofa. Lord Castlefort breathed with difficulty.
The rest walked about. While they were resting
on their oars, the young Duke roughly made up his accounts.
He found that he was minus about one hundred
thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>Immense as this loss was, he was more struck, more
appalled, let us say, at the strangeness of the surrounding
scene, than even by his own ruin. As he looked
upon his fellow gamesters, he seemed, for the first time
in his life, to gaze upon some of those hideous demons
of whom he had read. He looked in the mirror at himself.
A blight seemed to have fallen over his beauty,
and his presence seemed accursed. He had pursued a
dissipated, even more than a dissipated career. Many
were the nights that had been spent by him not on his
couch; great had been the exhaustion that he had often
experienced; haggard had sometimes even been the lustre
of his youth. But when had been marked upon his
brow this harrowing care? when had his features before
been stamped with this anxiety, this anguish, this baffled
desire, this strange unearthly scowl, which made him
even tremble? What! was it possible? it could not be,
that in time he was to be like those awful, those unearthly,
those unhallowed things that were around him.
He felt as if he had fallen from his state, as if he had
dishonored his ancestry, as if he had betrayed his trust.
He felt a criminal. In the darkness of his meditations
a flash burst from his lurid mind, a celestial light appeared
to dissipate this thickening gloom, and his soul
felt as if it were bathed with the softening radiancy. He
thought of May Dacre, he thought of everything that
was pure, and holy, and beautiful, and luminous, and
calm. It was the innate virtue of the man that made
this appeal to his corrupted nature. His losses seemed
nothing; his dukedom would be too slight a ransom for
freedom from these ghouls, and for the breath of the
sweet air.</p>

<p>He advanced to the Baron, and expressed his desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
play no more. There was an immediate stir. All jumped
up, and now the deed was done. Cant, in spite of their
exhaustion, assumed her reign. They begged him to
have his revenge, were quite annoyed at the result, had
no doubt he would recover if he proceeded. Without
noticing their remarks, he seated himself at the table, and
wrote cheques for their respective amounts, Tom Cogit
jumping up and bringing him the inkstand. Lord Castlefort,
in the most affectionate manner, pocketed the draft;
at the same time recommending the Duke not to be in a
hurry, but to send it when he was cool. Lord Dice received
his with a bow, Temple Grace with a sigh, the
Baron with an avowal of his readiness always to give him
his revenge.</p>

<p>The Duke, though sick at heart, would not leave the
room with any evidence of a broken spirit; and when
Lord Castlefort again repeated, "Pay us when we meet
again," he said, "I think it very improbable that we shall
meet again, my Lord. I wished to know what gaming
was. I had heard a great deal about it. It is not so
very disgusting; but I am a young man, and cannot play
tricks with my complexion."</p>

<p>He reached his house. He gave orders for himself not
to be disturbed, and he went to bed; but in vain he tried
to sleep. What rack exceeds the torture of an excited
brain and an exhausted body? His hands and feet were
like ice, his brow like fire; his ears rung with supernatural
roaring; a nausea had seized upon him, and death
he would have welcomed. In vain, in vain he courted
repose; in vain, in vain he had recourse to every expedient
to wile himself to slumber. Each minute he started
from his pillow with some phrase which reminded him of
his late fearful society. Hour after hour moved on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
its leaden pace; each hour he heard strike, and each
hour seemed an age. Each hour was only a signal to
cast off some covering, or shift his position. It was, at
length, morning. With a feeling that he should go mad
if he remained any longer in bed, he rose, and paced his
chamber. The air refreshed him. He threw himself on
the floor; the cold crept over his senses, and he slept.</p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>," said Wardle, after a substantial lunch had
been done ample justice to; "what say you to an hour
on the ice? We shall have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said Mr. Benjamin Allen.</p>

<p>"Prime!" ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer.</p>

<p>"You skate, of course, Winkle?" said Wardle.</p>

<p>"Ye-yes; oh, yes," replied Mr. Winkle. "I<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>am
<i>rather</i> out of practice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
"Oh, <i>do</i> skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. "I like to
see it so much."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is <i>so</i> graceful," said another young lady.</p>

<p>A third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth
expressed her opinion that it was "swan-like."</p>

<p>"I should be very happy, I'm sure," said Mr. Winkle,
reddening; "but I have no skates."</p>

<p>This objection was at once over-ruled. Trundle had
a couple of pair, and the fat boy announced that there
were half a dozen more down stairs: whereat Mr.
Winkle expressed exquisite delight, and looked exquisitely
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice;
and the fat boy and Mr. Weller, having shovelled and
swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the
night, Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity
which to Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and
described circles with his left leg, and cut figures of eight,
and inscribed upon the ice, without once stopping for
breath, a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices,
to the excessive satisfaction of Mr. Pickwick, Mr.
Tupman, and the ladies: which reached a pitch of positive
enthusiasm, when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen,
assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some
mystic evolutions, which they called a reel.</p>

<p>All this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands
blue with the cold, had been forcing a gimlet into the
soles of his feet, and putting his skates on, with the
points behind, and getting the straps into a very complicated
and entangled state, with the assistance of Mr.
Snodgrass, who knew rather less about skates than a
Hindoo. At length, however, with the assistance of Mr.
Weller, the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and
buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>"Now, then, sir," said Sam, in an encouraging tone;
"off vith you, and show 'em how to do it."</p>

<p>"Stop, Sam, stop!" said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently,
and clutching hold of Sam's arms with the grasp
of a drowning man. "How slippery it is, Sam!"</p>

<p>"Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr.
Weller. "Hold up, sir!"</p>

<p>This last observation of Mr. Weller's bore reference
to a demonstration Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a
frantic desire to throw his feet in the air, and dash the
back of his head on the ice.</p>

<p>"These<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>these<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>are very awkward skates; ain't they,
Sam?" inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering.</p>

<p>"I'm afeerd there's a orkard gen'l'm'n in 'em, sir," replied
Sam.</p>

<p>"Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious
that there was anything the matter. "Come; the ladies
are all anxiety."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile.
"I'm coming."</p>

<p>"Just a goin' to begin," said Sam, endeavoring to disengage
himself. "Now, sir, start off!"</p>

<p>"Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging
most affectionately to Mr. Weller. "I find I've got a
couple of coats at home that I don't want, Sam. You
may have them, Sam."</p>

<p>"Thank'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p>"Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr.
Winkle, hastily. "You needn't take your hand away to
do that. I meant to have given you five shillings this
morning for a Christmas-box, Sam. I'll give it you this
afternoon, Sam."</p>

<p>"You're wery good, sir," replied Mr. Weller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>"Just hold me at first, Sam; will you?" said Mr.
Winkle. "There<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that's right. I shall soon get in the
way of it, Sam. Not too fast, Sam; not too fast."</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle stooping forward, with his body half
doubled up, was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller,
in a very singular and un-swan-like manner, when
Mr. Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite
bank:</p>

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Here. I want you."</p>

<p>"Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don't you hear the governor
a callin'? Let go, sir."</p>

<p>With a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself
from the grasp of the agonized Pickwickian, and, in so
doing, administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy
Mr. Winkle. With an accuracy which no degree
of dexterity or practice could have insured, that unfortunate
gentleman bore swiftly down into the centre of the
reel, at the very moment when Mr. Bob Sawyer was performing
a flourish of unparalleled beauty. Mr. Winkle
struck wildly against him, and with a loud crash they
both fell heavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to the spot.
Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet, but Mr. Winkle was
far too wise to do anything of the kind, in skates. He
was seated on the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile;
but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" inquired Mr. Benjamin Allen, with
great anxiety.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Mr. Winkle, rubbing his back very
hard.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd let me bleed you," said Mr. Benjamin,
with great eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>"No, thank you," replied Mr. Winkle hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I really think you had better," said Allen.</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Mr. Winkle; "I'd rather not."</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think, Mr. Pickwick?" inquired Bob
Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick was excited and indignant. He beckoned
to Mr. Weller, and said in a stern voice, "Take his
skates off."</p>

<p>"No; but really I had scarcely begun," remonstrated
Mr. Winkle.</p>

<p>"Take his skates off," repeated Mr. Pickwick firmly.</p>

<p>The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle
allowed Sam to obey it in silence.</p>

<p>"Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him
to rise.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders;
and beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a
searching look upon him, and uttered in a low, but distinct
and emphatic tone, these remarkable words:</p>

<p>"You're a humbug, sir."</p>

<p>"A what?" said Mr. Winkle, starting.</p>

<p>"A humbug, sir. I will speak plainer, if you wish it.
An impostor, sir."</p>

<p>With these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his
heel, and rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>While Mr. Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment
just recorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having
by their joint endeavors cut out a slide, were exercising
themselves thereupon, in a very masterly and brilliant
manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying that
beautiful feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated
"knocking at the cobbler's door," and which is
achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot, and oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>casionally
giving a postman's knock upon it with the
other. It was a good long slide, and there was something
in the motion which Mr. Pickwick, who was very
cold with standing still, could not help envying.</p>

<p>"It looks a nice warm exercise that, doesn't it?" he
inquired of Wardle, when that gentleman was thoroughly
out of breath, by reason of the indefatigable manner in
which he had converted his legs into a pair of compasses,
and drawn complicated problems on the ice.</p>

<p>"Ah, it does indeed," replied Wardle. "Do you slide?"</p>

<p>"I used to do so on the gutters, when I was a boy," replied
Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>"Try it now," said Wardle.</p>

<p>"Oh do, please, Mr. Pickwick!" cried all the ladies.</p>

<p>"I should be very happy to afford you any amusement,"
replied Mr. Pickwick, "but I haven't done such a
thing these thirty years."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! Nonsense!" said Wardle, dragging off
his skates with the impetuosity which characterized all
his proceedings. "Here; I'll keep you company; come
along!" And away went the good tempered old fellow
down the slide, with a rapidity which came very close
upon Mr. Weller, and beat the fat boy all to nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves
and put them in his hat: took two or three short runs,
baulked himself as often, and at last took another run,
and went slowly and gravely down the slide, with his
feet about a yard and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified
shouts of all the spectators.</p>

<p>"Keep the pot a bilin', sir!" said Sam; and down
went Wardle again, and then Mr. Pickwick, and then
Sam, and then Mr. Winkle, and then Mr. Bob Sawyer,
and then the fat boy, and then Mr. Snodgrass, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
closely upon each other's heels, and running after each
other with as much eagerness as if all their future prospects
in life depended on their expedition.</p>

<p>It was the most intensely interesting thing, to observe
the manner in which Mr. Pickwick performed his share in
the ceremony; to watch the torture of anxiety with
which he viewed the person behind, gaining upon him at
the imminent hazard of tripping him up; to see him
gradually expend the painful force he had put on at first,
and turn slowly round on the slide, with his face towards
the point from which he had started; to contemplate the
playful smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished
the distance, and the eagerness with which
he turned round when he had done so, and ran after his
predecessor: his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through
the snow, and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness
through his spectacles. And when he was knocked
down (which happened upon the average every third
round), it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly
be imagined, to behold him gather up his hat,
gloves, and handkerchief, with a glowing countenance,
and resume his station in the rank, with an ardor and enthusiasm
that nothing could abate.</p>

<p>The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the
quickest, the laughter was at the loudest, when a sharp
smart crack was heard. There was a quick rush towards
the bank, a wild scream from the ladies, and a shout
from Mr. Tupman. A large mass of ice disappeared;
the water bubbled up over it; Mr. Pickwick's hat, gloves,
and handkerchief were floating on the surface; and this
was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody could see.</p>

<p>Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance,
the males turned pale, and the females fainted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by
the hand, and gazed at the spot where their leader had
gone down, with frenzied eagerness: while Mr. Tupman,
by way of rendering the promptest assistance, and at the
same time conveying to any persons who might be within
hearing, the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe,
ran off across the country at his utmost speed, screaming
"Fire!" with all his might.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, when old Wardle and Sam
Weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps,
and Mr. Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation
with Mr. Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding
the company generally, as an improving little bit of professional
practice<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it was at this very moment, that a
face, head, and shoulders, emerged from beneath the
water, and disclosed the features and spectacles of Mr.
Pickwick.</p>

<p>"Keep yourself up for an instant<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for only one instant!"
bawled Mr. Snodgrass.</p>

<p>"Yes, do; let me implore you<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for my sake!" roared
Mr. Winkle, deeply affected. The adjuration was rather
unnecessary; the probability being, that if Mr. Pickwick
had declined to keep himself up for anybody else's sake,
it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so,
for his own.</p>

<p>"Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow?" said
Wardle.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, wringing the
water from his head and face, and gasping for breath. "I
fell upon my back. I couldn't get on my feet at first."</p>

<p>The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick's coat as was
yet visible, bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement;
and as the fears of the spectators were still fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>ther
relieved by the fat boy's suddenly recollecting that
the water was nowhere more than five feet deep, prodigies
of valor were performed to get him out. After a
vast quantity of splashing, and cracking, and struggling,
Mr. Pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his
unpleasant position, and once more stood on dry land.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll catch his death of cold," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Dear old thing!" said Arabella. "Let me wrap this
shawl round you, Mr. Pickwick."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the best thing you can do," said Wardle;
"and when you've got it on, run home as fast as your
legs can carry you, and jump into bed directly."</p>

<p>A dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or
four of the thickest having been selected, Mr. Pickwick
was wrapped up, and started off, under the guidance of
Mr. Weller: presenting the singular phenomenon of an
elderly gentleman, dripping wet, and without a hat, with
his arms bound down to his sides, skimming over the
ground, without any clearly defined purpose, at the rate
of six good English miles an hour.</p>

<p>But Mr. Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an
extreme case, and urged on by Sam Weller, he kept at
the very top of his speed until he reached the door of
Manor Farm, where Mr. Tupman had arrived some five
minutes before, and had frightened the old lady into palpitations
of the heart by impressing her with the unalterable
conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a
calamity which always presented itself in glowing
colors to the old lady's mind, when anybody about her
evinced the smallest agitation.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug
in bed. Sam Weller lighted a blazing fire in his room,
and took up his dinner, and afterwards a great rejoicing
was held in honor of his safety.<br /><br /></p>

<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Like a new star just sprung to birth,</span><br />

<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And merry was the feast and long.</span></p>

<p>II.</p>

<p>And now I sit and muse on what may be,<br />
And in my vision see, or seem to see,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Through floating vapors interfused with light,</span><br />
Shapes indeterminate, that gleam and fade,<br />
As shadows passing into deeper shade<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Sink and elude the sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">For two alone, there in the hall,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Is spread the table round and small;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Upon the polish'd silver shine</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The evening lamps, but, more divine,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span><span style="padding-left: 4em;">The light of love shines over all;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Of love, that says not mine and thine,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">But ours, for ours is thine and mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">They want no guests, to come between</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Their tender glances like a screen,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And tell them tales of land and sea,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And whatsoever may betide</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The great, forgotten world outside;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">They want no guests; they needs must be</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Each other's own best company.</span></p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>The picture fades; as at a village fair<br />
A showman's views, dissolving into air,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Again appear transfigured on the screen,</span><br />
So in my fancy this; and now once more,<br />
In part transfigured, through the open door<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Appears the selfsame scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">Seated, I see the two again,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">But not alone; they entertain</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">A little angel unaware,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">With face as round as is the moon;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">A royal guest with flaxen hair,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Who, throned upon his lofty chair,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Drums on the table with his spoon,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Then drops it careless on the floor,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">To grasp at things unseen before.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">Are these celestial manners? these</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The ways that win, the arts that please?</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Ah yes; consider well the guest,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And whatsoe'er he does seems best;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">He ruleth by the right divine</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Of helplessness, so lately born</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">In purple chambers of the morn,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">As sovereign over thee and thine.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">He speaketh not; and yet there lies</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">A conversation in his eyes;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The golden silence of the Greek,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The gravest wisdom of the wise,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Not spoken in language, but in looks</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">More legible than printed books,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">As if he could but would not speak.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And now, O monarch absolute,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Thy power is put to proof; for, lo!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Resistless, fathomless, and slow,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The nurse comes rustling like the sea,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And pushes back thy chair and thee,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And so good night to King Canute.</span></p>

<p>IV.</p>

<p>As one who walking in a forest sees<br />
A lovely landscape through the parted trees,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Then sees it not, for boughs that intervene;</span><br />
Or, as we see the moon sometimes reveal'd<br />
Through drifting clouds, and then again conceal'd,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">So I behold the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">There are two guests at table now;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The king, deposed and older grown,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">No longer occupies the throne,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The crown is on his sister's brow;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">A Princess from the Fairy Isles,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The very pattern girl of girls,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">All cover'd and embower'd in curls,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Rose-tinted from the Isle of Flowers,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And sailing with soft, silken sails</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">From far-off Dreamland into ours.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Above their bowls with rims of blue</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Four azure eyes of deeper hue</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Are looking, dreamy with delight;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Limpid as planets that emerge</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Above the ocean's rounded verge,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Soft-shining through the summer night.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Steadfast they gaze, yet nothing see</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Beyond the horizon of their bowls;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Nor care they for the world that rolls</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">With all its freight of troubled souls</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Into the days that are to be.</span></p>

<p>V.</p>

<p>Again the tossing boughs shut out the scene,<br />
Again the drifting vapors intervene,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And the moon's pallid disk is hidden quite:</span><br />
And now I see the table wider grown,<br />
As round a pebble into water thrown<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Dilates a ring of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">I see the table wider grown,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">I see it garlanded with guests,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">As if fair Ariadne's Crown</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Out of the sky had fallen down;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Maidens within whose tender breasts</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">A thousand restless hopes and fears,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Forth reaching to the coming years,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Flutter awhile, then quiet lie,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Like timid birds that fain would fly,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">But do not dare to leave their nests;</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And youths, who in their strength elate</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Challenge the van and front of fate,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Eager as champions to be</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">In the divine knight-errantry</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Of youth, that travels sea and land</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Seeking adventures, or pursues,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Through cities, and through solitudes</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Frequented by the lyric Muse,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The phantom with the beckoning hand,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">That still allures and still eludes.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">O sweet illusions of the brain!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">O sudden thrills of fire and frost!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The world is bright while ye remain,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And dark and dead when ye are lost!</span></p>

<p>VI.</p>

<p>The meadow-brook, that seemeth to stand still,<br />
Quickens its current as it nears the mill;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And so the stream of Time that lingereth</span><br />
In level places, and so dull appears,<br />
Runs with a swifter current as it nears<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The gloomy mills of Death.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">And now, like the magician's scroll,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">That in the owner's keeping shrinks</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">With every wish he speaks or thinks,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Till the last wish consumes the whole,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The table dwindles, and again</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">I see the two alone remain.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The crown of stars is broken in parts;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Its jewels, brighter than the day,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Have one by one been stolen away</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">To shine in other homes and hearts.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">One is a wanderer now afar</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Or sunny regions of Cathay;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And one is in the boisterous camp</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Mid clink of arms and horses' tramp,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And battle's terrible array.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">I see the patient mother read,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">With aching heart, of wrecks that float</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Disabled on those seas remote,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Or of some great heroic deed</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">On battle-fields, where thousands bleed</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">To lift one hero into fame.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Anxious she bends her graceful head</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Above these chronicles of pain,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And trembles with a secret dread</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Lest there among the drown'd or slain</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">She find the one belov</span><ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d name.</p>

<p>After a day of cloud and wind and rain<br />
Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And, touching all the darksome woods with light.</span><br />
Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,<br />
Then like a ruby from the horizon's ring<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Drops down into the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">What see I now? The night is fair,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The storm of grief, the clouds of care,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The wind, the rain, have pass'd away;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The lamps are lit, the fires burn bright,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The house is full of life and light:</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">It is the Golden Wedding day.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The guests come thronging in once more,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Quick footsteps sound along the floor,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The trooping children crowd the stair,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And in and out and everywhere</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Flashes along the corridor</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The sunshine of their golden hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">On the round table in the hall</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Another Ariadne's Crown</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Out of the sky hath fallen down;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">More than one Monarch of the Moon</span><br />

<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The light of love shines over all.</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left: 4em;">O fortunate, O happy day!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The people sing, the people say.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">The ancient bridegroom and the bride,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Smiling contented and serene,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Upon the blithe, bewildering scene,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Behold, well pleas'd, on every side</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Their forms and features multiplied,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">As the reflection of a light</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Between two burnish'd mirrors gleams,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Or lamps upon a bridge at night</span><br />

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Charles Darwin</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1809-1882.</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Formation of Vegetable Mould<br />through the action of
Worms</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Worms</span> have played a more important part in the history
of the world than most persons would at first suppose.
In almost all humid countries they are extraordinarily
numerous, and for their size possess great muscular
power. In many parts of England a weight of more
than ten tons of dry earth annually passes through their
bodies and is brought to the surface on each acre of
land; so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable
mould passes through their bodies in the course of every
few years. From the collapsing of the old burrows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
mould is in constant though slow movement, and the
particles composing it are thus rubbed together. By
these means fresh surfaces are continually exposed to
the action of the carbonic acid in the soil, and of the
humus-acids which appear to be still more efficient in
the decomposition of rocks. The generation of the
humus-acids is probably hastened during the digestion
of the many half-decayed leaves which worms consume.
Thus the particles of earth, forming the superficial
mould, are subjected to conditions eminently favorable
for their decomposition and disintegration. Moreover,
the particles of the softer rocks suffer some amount of
mechanical trituration in the muscular gizzards of worms,
in which small stones serve as mill-stones....</p>

<p>Arch<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>ologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they
protect and preserve for an indefinitely long period every
object, not liable to decay, which is dropped on the surface
of the land, by burying it beneath their castings.
Thus, also, many elegant and curious tesselated pavements
and other ancient remains have been preserved;
though no doubt the worms have in these cases been
largely aided by earth washed and blown from the adjoining
land, especially when cultivated. The old tesselated
pavements have, however, often suffered by having
subsided unequally from being unequally undermined by
the worms. Even old massive walls may be undermined
and subside; and no building is in this respect safe, unless
the foundations lie six or seven feet beneath the surface,
at a depth at which worms cannot work. It is probable
that many monoliths and some old walls have
fallen down from having been undermined by worms.</p>

<p>Worms prepare the ground in an excellent manner for
the growth of fibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
all kinds. They periodically expose the mould to the
air, and sift it so that no stones larger than the particles
which they can swallow are left in it. They mingle the
whole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares
fine soil for his choicest plants. In this state it is well
fitted to retain moisture and to absorb all soluble substances,
as well as for the process of nitrification. The
bones of dead animals, the harder parts of insects, the
shells of land-molluscs, leaves, twigs, etc., are before
long all buried beneath the accumulated castings of
worms, and are thus brought in a more or less decayed
state within reach of the roots of plants. Worms likewise
drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other
parts of plants into their burrows, partly for the sake of
plugging them up and partly as food.</p>

<p>The leaves which are dragged into the burrows as
food, after being torn into the finest shreds, partially digested,
and saturated with the intestinal secretions, are
commingled with much earth. This earth forms the
dark-colored, rich humus which almost everywhere
covers the surface of the land with a fairly well-defined
layer or mantle. Von Hensen placed two worms in a
vessel eighteen inches in diameter, which was filled with
sand, on which fallen leaves were strewed; and these
were soon dragged into their burrows to a depth of three
inches. After about six weeks an almost uniform layer
of sand, a centimetre (.4 inch) in thickness, was converted
into humus by having passed through the alimentary
canals of these two worms. It is believed by some persons
that worm-burrows, which often penetrate the
ground almost perpendicularly to a depth of five or six
feet, materially aid in its drainage; notwithstanding that
the viscid castings piled over the mouths of the burrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
prevent or check the rain-water directly entering them.
They allow the air to penetrate deeply into the ground.
They also greatly facilitate the downward passage of
roots of moderate size; and these will be nourished by
the humus with which the burrows are lined. Many
seeds owe their germination to having been covered by
castings; and others buried to a considerable depth beneath
accumulated castings lie dormant, until at some
future time they are accidentally uncovered and germinate.</p>

<p>Worms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for
they cannot be said to see, although they can just distinguish
between light and darkness; they are completely
deaf, and have only a feeble power of smell; the
sense of touch alone is well developed. They can therefore
learn little about the outside world, and it is surprising
that they should exhibit some skill in lining their burrows
with their castings and with leaves, and in the case
of some species in piling up their castings into tower-like
constructions. But it is far more surprising that they
should apparently exhibit some degree of intelligence
instead of a mere blind instinctive impulse, in their manner
of plugging up the mouths of their burrows. They
act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had
to close a cylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves,
petioles, triangles of paper, etc., for they commonly seize
such objects by their pointed ends. But with thin objects
a certain number are drawn in by their broader
ends. They do not act in the same unvarying manner
in all cases, as do most of the lower animals; for instance,
they do not drag in leaves by their foot-stalks,
unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow as the
apex, or narrower than it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>When we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we
should remember that its smoothness, on which so much
of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all the inequalities
having been slowly levelled by worms. It is a marvellous
reflection that the whole of the superficial mould
over any such expanse has passed, and will again pass,
every few years, through the bodies of worms. The
plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of
man's inventions; but long before he existed the land
was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be
thus ploughed by earth-worms. It may be doubted
whether there are many other animals which have played
so important a part in the history of the world, as have
these lowly organized creatures.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Arthur Penrhyn Stanley</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1815-1880.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> his usual and undoubting confidence in what he
believed to be a general law of Providence, he based his
whole management of the school on his early-formed
and yearly-increasing conviction that what he had to
look for, both intellectually and morally, was not performance
but promise; that the very freedom and independence
of school life, which in itself he thought so dangerous,
might be made the best preparation for Christian
manhood; and he did not hesitate to apply to his scholars
the principle which seemed to him to have been adopted
in the training of the childhood of the human race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
itself. He shrunk from pressing on the conscience of
boys rules of action which he felt they were not yet
able to bear, and from enforcing actions which, though
right in themselves, would in boys be performed from
wrong motives. Keenly as he felt the risk and fatal consequences
of the failure of this trial, still it was his great,
sometimes his only support to believe that "the character
is braced amid such scenes to a greater beauty and firmness
than it ever can attain without enduring and witnessing
them. Our work here would be absolutely unendurable
if we did not bear in mind that we should
look forward as well as backward<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if we did not remember
that the victory of fallen man lies not in innocence
but in tried virtue." "I hold fast," he said, "to the
great truth, that 'blessed is he that overcometh;'" and
he writes in 1837: "Of all the painful things connected
with my employment, nothing is equal to the grief of
seeing a boy come to school innocent and promising, and
tracing the corruption of his character from the influence
of the temptations around him, in the very place
which ought to have strengthened and improved it. But
in most cases those who come with a character of positive
good are benefited; it is the neutral and indecisive
characters which are apt to be decided for evil by schools,
as they would be in fact by any other temptation."</p>

<p>But this very feeling led him with the greater eagerness
to catch at every means by which the trial might be shortened
or alleviated. "Can the change from childhood to
manhood be hastened, without prematurely exhausting
the faculties of body or mind?" was one of the chief
questions on which his mind was constantly at work, and
which in the judgment of some he was disposed to answer
too readily in the affirmative. It was with the elder boys,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of course, that he chiefly acted on this principle, but with
all above the very young ones he trusted to it more or
less. Firmly as he believed that <i>a</i> time of trial was inevitable,
he believed no less firmly that it might be passed
at public schools sooner than under other circumstances;
and, in proportion as he disliked the assumption of a
false manliness in boys, was his desire to cultivate in
them true manliness, as the only step to something
higher, and to dwell on earnest principle and moral
thoughtfulness, as the great and distinguishing mark between
good and evil. Hence his wish that as much as
possible should be done <i>by</i> the boys, and nothing <i>for</i>
them; hence arose his practice, in which his own delicacy
of feeling and uprightness of purpose powerfully
assisted him, of treating the boys as gentlemen and
reasonable beings, of making them respect themselves
by the mere respect he showed to them; of showing
that he appealed and trusted to their own common sense
and conscience. Lying, for example, to the masters, he
made a great moral offence: placing implicit confidence
in a boy's assertion, and then, if a falsehood was discovered,
punishing it severely,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>in the upper part of the school,
when persisted in, with expulsion. Even with the lower
forms he never seemed to be on the watch for boys; and
in the higher forms any attempt at further proof of an assertion
was immediately checked: "If you say so, that
is quite enough<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>of course</i> I believe your word;" and
there grew up in consequence a general feeling that "it
was a shame to tell Arnold a lie<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>he always believes one."</p>

<p>Perhaps the liveliest representation of this general
spirit, as distinguished from its exemplification in particular
parts of the discipline and instruction, would be
formed by recalling his manner, as he appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
great school, where the boys used to meet when the
whole school was assembled collectively, and not in its
different forms or classes. Then, whether on his usual
entrance every morning to prayers before the first lesson,
or on the more special emergencies which might require
his presence, he seemed to stand before them, not merely
as the head-master, but as the representative of the
school. There he spoke to them as members together
with himself of the same great institution, whose character
and reputation they had to sustain as well as he. He
would dwell on the satisfaction he had in being head of
a society, where noble and honorable feelings were encouraged,
or on the disgrace which he felt in hearing of
acts of disorder or violence, such as in the humbler ranks
of life would render them amenable to the laws of their
country; or again, on the trust which he placed in
their honor as gentlemen, and the baseness of any instance
in which it was abused. "Is this a Christian
school?" he indignantly asked at the end of one of those
addresses, in which he had spoken of an extensive display
of bad feeling amongst the boys; and then added,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"I
cannot remain here if all this is to be carried on by
constraint and force; if I am to be here as a jailer, I will
resign my office at once." And few scenes can be recorded
more characteristic of him than on one of these
occasions, when, in consequence of a disturbance, he had
been obliged to send away several boys, and when in the
midst of the general spirit of discontent which this excited,
he stood in his place before the assembled school
and said: "It is <i>not</i> necessary that this should be a school
of three hundred, or one hundred, or of fifty boys; but
it <i>is</i> necessary that it should be a school of Christian
gentlemen."</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Maggie was trotting with her own
fishing-rod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the
other, stepping always, by a peculiar gift, in the muddiest
places, and looking darkly radiant from under her beaver
bonnet because Tom was good to her. She had told
Tom, however, that she should like him to put the worms
on the hook for her, although she accepted his word when
he assured her that worms couldn't feel (it was Tom's
private opinion that it didn't much matter if they did).
He knew all about worms, and fish, and those things;
and what birds were mischievous, and how padlocks
opened, and which way the handles of the gates were to
be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was
very wonderful<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>much more difficult than remembering
what was in the books; and she was rather in awe of
Tom's superiority, for he was the only person who called
her knowledge "stuff," and did not feel surprised at her
cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie
was a silly little thing; all girls were silly; they couldn't
throw a stone so as to hit anything, couldn't do anything
with a pocket-knife, and were frightened at frogs. Still,
he was very fond of his sister, and meant always to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her
when she did wrong.</p>

<p>They were on their way to the Round Pool<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that
wonderful pool, which the floods had made a long while
ago. No one knew how deep it was; and it was mysterious,
too, that it should be almost a perfect round,
framed in with willows and tall reeds, so that the water
was only to be seen when you got close to the brink.
The sight of the old favorite spot always heightened
Tom's good-humor, and he spoke to Maggie in the most
amiable whispers, as he opened the precious basket and
prepared their tackle. He threw her line for her, and
put the rod into her hand. Maggie thought it probable
that the small fish would come to her hook, and the large
ones to Tom's. But she had forgotten all about the fish,
and was looking dreamily at the glassy water, when Tom
said, in a loud whisper, "Look! look, Maggie!" and came
running to prevent her from snatching her line away.</p>

<p>Maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something
wrong, as usual, but presently Tom drew out her
line and brought a large tench bouncing on the grass.</p>

<p>Tom was excited.</p>

<p>"O Magsie! you little duck! Empty the basket."</p>

<p>Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was
enough that Tom called her Magsie, and was pleased
with her. There was nothing to mar her delight in the
whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened to
the light dipping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle
rustling, as if the willows, and the reeds, and the water
had their happy whisperings also. Maggie thought it
would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that
way, and never be scolded. She never knew she had a
bite till Tom told her, but she liked fishing very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
It was one of their happy mornings. They trotted
along and sat down together, with no thought that life
would ever change much for them: they would only get
bigger and not go to school, and it would always be like
the holidays; they would always live together and be
fond of each other. And the mill with its booming<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the
great chestnut-tree under which they played at houses<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>their
own little river, the Ripple, where the banks seemed
like home, and Tom was always seeing the water-rats,
while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the
reeds, which she forgot and dropped afterward<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>above
all, the great Floss, along which they wandered with a
sense of travel, to see the rushing spring-tide, the awful
Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the
Great Ash which had once wailed and groaned like a
man<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>these things would always be just the same to
them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who
lived on any other spot of the globe; and Maggie, when
she read about Christiana passing "the river over which
there is no bridge," always saw the Floss between the
green pastures by the Great Ash.</p>

<p>Life did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they
were not wrong in believing that the thoughts and loves
of these first years would always make part of their lives.
We could never have loved the earth so well if we had
had no childhood in it<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>if it were not the earth where
the same flowers come up again every spring that we
used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to
ourselves on the grass<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the same hips and haws on the
autumn hedgerows<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the same red-breasts that we used
to call "God's birds," because they did no harm to the
precious crops. What novelty is worth that sweet monotony
where everything is known, and <i>loved</i> because it is
known?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the
young yellow-brown foliage of the oaks between me and
the blue sky, the white star-flowers, and the blue-eyed
speedwell, and the ground-ivy at my feet<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>what grove of
tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petaled
blossoms, could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres
within me as this home-scene? These familiar flowers,
these well-remembered bird-notes, this sky with its fitful
brightness, these furrowed and grassy fields, each with a
sort of personality given to it by the capricious hedgerows<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>such
things as these are the mother tongue of our
imagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle
inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood
left behind them. Our delight in the sunshine on
the deep-bladed grass to-day might be no more than the
faint perception of wearied souls, if it were not for the
sunshine and the grass in the far-off years, which still live
in us, and transform our perception into love.</p>

<p>Over the mountains winding down,<br />
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.</p>

<p>Forty flags with their silver stars,<br />
Forty flags with their crimson bars,</p>

<p>Flapp'd in the morning wind: the sun<br />

<p>Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,<br />
Bow'd with her fourscore years and ten;</p>

<p>Bravest of all in Frederick town,<br />
She took up the flag the men haul'd down;</p>

<p>In her attic-window the staff she set,<br />
To show that one heart was loyal yet.</p>

<p>Up the street came the rebel tread,<br />
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.</p>

<p>Under his slouch'd hat left and right<br />
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.</p>

<p>"Halt!"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the dust-brown ranks stood fast<br />
"Fire!"<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>out blazed the rifle-blast.</p>

Dame Barbara snatch'd the silken scarf;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>She lean'd far out on the window-sill,<br />
And shook it forth with a royal will.<br />
</p>

<p>"Shoot, if you must, this old grey head,<br />
But spare your country's flag!" she said.</p>

<p>A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,<br />
Over the face of the leader came;</p>

<p>The nobler nature within him stirr'd<br />
To life at that woman's deed and word:</p>

<p>"Who touches a hair of yon grey head,<br />
Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.</p>

<p>All day long through Frederick street<br />
Sounded the tread of marching feet:</p>

<p>All day long that free flag toss'd<br />
Over the heads of the rebel host.</p>

<p>Ever its torn folds rose and fell<br />
On the loyal winds that lov'd it well;</p>

<p>And through the hill-gaps sunset light<br />
Shone over it with a warm good-night.</p>

<p>Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,<br />
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more</p>

<p>Honor to her! and let a tear<br />
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Constitution has not been the offspring of the
thought of man. The Cabinet, and all the present relations
of the Constitutional powers in this country, have
grown into their present dimensions, and settled into
their present places, not as the fruit of a philosophy, not
in the effort to give effect to an abstract principle; but
by the silent action of forces, invisible and insensible, the
structure has come up into the view of all the world. It
is, perhaps, the most conspicuous object on the wide
political horizon; but it has thus risen, without noise,
like the temple of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="block" style="width: 330px; font-size: smaller">
<p>"No workman steel, no ponderous hammers rung;<br />
Like some tall palm the stately fabric sprung."</p>
</div>

<p>When men repeat the proverb which teaches us that
"marriages are made in heaven," what they mean is that,
in the most fundamental of all social operations, the
building up of the family, the issues involved in the
nuptial contract, lie beyond the best exercise of human
thought, and the unseen forces of providential government
make good the defect in our imperfect capacity.
Even so would it seem to have been in that curious marriage
of competing influences and powers, which brings
about the composite harmony of the British Constitution.
More, it must be admitted, than any other, it leaves open
doors which lead into blind alleys; for it presumes, more
boldly than any other, the good sense and good faith of
those who work it. If, unhappily, these personages meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
together, on the great arena of a nation's fortunes, as
jockeys meet upon a racecourse, each to urge to the
uttermost, as against the others, the power of the animal
he rides; or as counsel in a court, each to procure the
victory of his client, without respect to any other interest
or right: then this boasted Constitution of ours is neither
more nor less than a heap of absurdities. The undoubted
competency of each reaches even to the paralysis or destruction
of the rest. The House of Commons is entitled
to refuse every shilling of the Supplies. That House,
and also the House of Lords, is entitled to refuse its
assent to every Bill presented to it. The Crown is entitled
to make a thousand Peers to-day, and as many to-morrow:
it may dissolve all and every Parliament before
it proceeds to business; may pardon the most atrocious
crimes; may declare war against all the world; may
conclude treaties involving unlimited responsibilities, and
even vast expenditure, without the consent, nay without
the knowledge, of Parliament, and this not merely in
support or in development, but in reversal, of policy already
known to and sanctioned by the nation. But the
assumption is that the depositaries of power will all respect
one another; will evince a consciousness that they
are working in a common interest for a common end;
that they will be possessed, together with not less than
an average intelligence, of not less than an average sense
of equity and of the public interest and rights. When
these reasonable expectations fail, then, it must be admitted,
the British Constitution will be in danger.</p>

<p>Apart from such contingencies, the offspring only of
folly or of crime, this Constitution is peculiarly liable to
subtle change. Not only in the long-run, as man changes
between youth and age, but also, like the human body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
with a quotidian life, a periodical recurrence of ebbing
and flowing tides. Its old particles daily run to waste,
and give place to new. What is hoped among us is, that
which has usually been found, that evils will become
palpable before they have grown to be intolerable....</p>

<p>Meantime, we of this island are not great political
philosophers; and we contend with an earnest, but disproportioned,
vehemence about changes which are palpable,
such as the extension of the suffrage, or the redistribution
of Parliamentary seats, neglecting wholly other
processes of change which work beneath the surface, and
in the dark, but which are even more fertile of great
organic results. The modern English character reflects
the English Constitution in this, that it abounds in paradox;
that it possesses every strength, but holds it tainted
with every weakness; that it seems alternately both to
rise above and to fall below the standard of average
humanity; that there is no allegation of praise or blame
which, in some one of the aspects of its many-sided
formation, it does not deserve; that only in the midst of
much default, and much transgression, the people of this
United Kingdom either have heretofore established, or
will hereafter establish, their title to be reckoned among
the children of men, for the eldest born of an imperial
race.</p>

But a trouble weigh'd upon her,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">And perplex'd her, night and morn,</span><br />
With the burden of an honor<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Unto which she was not born.</span><br />
Faint she grew, and ever fainter,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">As she murmur'd, "O, that he</span><br />
Were once more that landscape-painter,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Which did win my heart from me!"</span><br />
So she droop'd and droop'd before him,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Fading slowly from his side:</span><br />
Three fair children first she bore him,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Then before her time she died.</span><br />
Weeping, weeping late and early,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Walking up and pacing down,</span><br />
Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.</span><br />
And he came to look upon her,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">And he look'd at her and said,</span><br />
"Bring the dress and put it on her,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">That she wore when she was wed."</span><br />
Then her people, softly treading,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">Bore to earth her body, drest</span><br />
In the dress that she was wed in,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em">That her spirit might have rest.</span></p>

<h4>A BALLAD OF THE FLEET, 1591.</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lord Tennyson</span>.</h4>

<div class="block" style="width: 560px;">
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,<br />
And a pinnace, like a flutter'd bird, came flying from far away:<br />
"Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!"<br />
Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: "'Fore God I am no coward!<br />
But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.<br />
We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"</p>

<p>
Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are no coward;<br />
You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.<br />
But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.<br />
I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,<br />
To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."</p>

<p>
So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,<br />
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;<br />
But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land<br />
Very carefully and slow,<br />
Men of Bideford in Devon,<br />
And we laid them on the ballast down below;<br />
For we brought them all aboard,<br />
And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,<br />
To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.</p>

<p>
He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,<br />
And he sail'd away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,<br />
With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.<br />
"Shall we fight or shall we fly?<br />
Good Sir Richard, let us know,<br />
For to fight is but to die!<br />
There'll be little of us left by the time the sun be set."<br />
And Sir Richard said again: "We be all good Englishmen.<br />
Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,<br />
For I never turn'd my back upon Don or devil yet."</p>

<p>
Sir Richard spoke, and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah, and so<br />
The little "Revenge" ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,<br />
With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;<br />
For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,<br />
And the little "Revenge" ran on thro' the long sea-lane between.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Thousands of their soldiers look'd down from their decks and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">laugh'd,</span><br />
Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft<br />
Running on and on, till delay'd<br />
By their mountain-like "San Philip" that, of fifteen hundred tons,<br />
And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,<br />
Took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd.</p>

<p>
And while now the great "San Philip" hung above us like a cloud<br />
Whence the thunderbolt will fall<br />
Long and loud,<br />
Four galleons drew away<br />
From the Spanish fleet that day,<br />
And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,<br />
And the battle-thunder broke from them all.</p>

<p>
But anon the great "San Philip," she bethought herself and went,<br />
Having that within her womb that had left her ill-content;<br />
And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">hand,</span><br />
For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,<br />
And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears<br />
When he leaps from the water to the land.</p>

<p>
And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">summer sea,</span><br />
But never a moment ceas'd the fight of the one and the fifty-three.<br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">came,</span><br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, with their battle-thunder<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and flame;</span><br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and her shame;</span><br />
For some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">us no more</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
For he said, "Fight on! fight on!"<br />
Tho' his vessel was all but a wreck;<br />
And it chanced that, when half of the summer night was gone,<br />
With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,<br />
But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,<br />
And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,<br />
And he said, "Fight on! fight on!"</p>

<p>
And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">summer sea,</span><br />
And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;<br />
But they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">could sting,</span><br />
So they watch'd what the end would be.<br />
And we had not fought them in vain,<br />
But in perilous plight were we,<br />
Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,<br />
And half of the rest of us maim'd for life<br />
In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;<br />
And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">and cold,</span><br />
And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">of it spent;</span><br />
And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;<br />
But Sir Richard cried in his English pride,<br />
"We have fought such a fight for a day and a night<br />
As may never be fought again!<br />
We have won great glory, my men!<br />
And a day less or more<br />
At sea or shore,<br />
We die<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>does it matter when?<br />
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>sink her, split her in twain!<br />
Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!"</p>

<p>
And the gunner said, "Ay, ay," but the seamen made reply:<br />
"We have children, we have wives,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
And the Lord hath spared our lives.<br />
We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;<br />
We shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow."<br />
And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.</p>

<p>
And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,<br />
Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,<br />
And they prais'd him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;<br />
But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:<br />
"I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;<br />
I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:<br />
With a joyful spirit I, Sir Richard Grenville, die!"<br />
And he fell upon their decks, and he died.</p>

<p>
And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,<br />
And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap,<br />
That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;<br />
Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,<br />
But they sank his body with honor down into the deep,<br />
And they mann'd the "Revenge" with a swarthier alien crew,<br />
And away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own;<br />
When a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep,<br />
And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,<br />
And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,<br />
And a wave like the wave that is rais'd by an earthquake grew,<br />
Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">their flags,</span><br />
And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">of Spain,</span><br />
And the little "Revenge" herself went down by the island crags<br />
To be lost evermore in the main.</p>

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Did the English fight the French,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>woe to France!<br />
And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue,<br />
Like a crowd of frighten'd porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,</span><br />
With the English fleet in view.</p>

<p>'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Close on him fled, great and small,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Twenty-two good ships in all;</span><br />
And they signall'd to the place<br />
"Help the winners of a race!<br />

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Here's the English can and will!"</span></p>

<p>Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?"</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">laugh'd they:</span><br />
"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarr'd and<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">scored,</span><br />
Shall the <i>Formidable</i> here with her twelve and eighty guns<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,</span><br />
Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">And with flow at full beside?</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Reach the mooring? Rather say,</span><br />
While rock stands or water runs,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Not a ship will leave the bay!"</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Then was call'd a council straight.<br />
Brief and bitter the debate:<br />
"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take<br />
<span style="padding-left: 6em;">in tow</span><br />
All that's left us of the fleet, link'd together stern and bow,<br />
For a prize to Plymouth Sound?<br />
Better run the ships aground!"<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">(Ended Damfreville his speech.)</span><br />
Not a minute more to wait!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"Let the captains all and each</span><br />

<p>Not a minute more to wait.<br />
"Steer us in, then, small and great!<br />

Captains, give the sailor place!<br />

Still the north-wind, by God's grace!<br />
See the noble fellow's face<br />
As the big ship, with a bound,<br />
Clears the entry like a hound,<br />
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's<br />

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">See, safe through shoal and rock,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">How they follow in a flock!</span><br />
Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Not a spar that comes to grief!</span><br />

So, the storm subsides to calm:<br />

Hearts that bled are stanch'd with balm.<br />
"Just our rapture to enhance,<br />

Gnash their teeth and glare askance<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">As they cannonade away!</span><br />
'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!"<br />
Now hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance!<br />
Out burst all with one accord,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"This is Paradise for Hell!</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 4em;">Let France, let France's king,</span><br />

What a shout, and all one word,<br />

As he stepp'd in front once more,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Not a symptom of surprise</span><br />

Just the same man as before.</p>

<p>Then said Damfreville, "My friend,<br />
I must speak out at the end,<br />

Praise is deeper than the lips;<br />
You have saved the king his ships,<br />

'Faith our sun was near eclipse!<br />
Demand whate'er you will,<br />
France remains your debtor still.<br />
Ask to heart's content, and have! or my name's not Damfreville."</p>

<p>Then a beam of fun outbroke<br />
On the bearded mouth that spoke,<br />
As the honest heart laugh'd through<br />
Those frank eyes of Breton blue:<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">Benjamin Jowett</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1817-</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">The Dialogues of Plato</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return
for the evil name which you will get from the detractors
of the city, who will say that you killed Socrates, a wise
man; for they will call me wise, even although I am not
wise, when they want to reproach you. If you had waited
a little while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the
course of nature. For I am far advanced in years, as you
may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking
now only to those of you who have condemned me to
death. And I have another thing to say to them: You
think that I was convicted through deficiency of words<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I
mean, that if I had thought fit to leave nothing undone,
nothing unsaid, I might have gained an acquittal. Not
so; the deficiency which led to my conviction was not
of words<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>certainly not. But I had not the boldness or
impudence or inclination to address you as you would
have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and
lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you
have been accustomed to hear from others, and which,
as I say, are unworthy of me. But I thought that I
ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour
of danger: nor do I now repent of the manner of my
defense, and I would rather die having spoken after my
manner, than speak in your manner and live. For neither
in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way
of escaping death. For often in battle there is no doubt
that if a man will throw away his arms, and fall on his
knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if
a man is willing to say and do anything. The difficulty,
my friends, is not in avoiding death, but in avoiding unrighteousness;
for that runs faster than death. I am old
and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken
me, and my accusers are keen and quick, and the faster
runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken them. And
now I depart hence, condemned by you to suffer the
penalty of death, and they too go their ways, condemned
by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong;
and I must abide by my award<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>let them abide by theirs.
I suppose that these things may be regarded as fated,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
I think that they are well.</p>

<p>And now, O men who have condemned me, I would
fain prophesy to you; for I am about to die, and that is
the hour in which men are gifted with prophetic power.
And I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that immediately
after my death punishment far heavier than
you have inflicted on me will surely await you. Me you
have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser,
and not to give an account of your lives. But that will
not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For I say that
there will be more accusers of you than there are now;
accusers whom hitherto I have restrained: and as they
are younger they will be more severe with you, and you
will be more offended at them. For if you think that by
killing men you can avoid the accuser censuring your
lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape
which is either possible or honorable; the easiest and
the noblest way is not to be crushing others, but to be
improving yourselves. This is the prophecy which I
utter before my departure to the judges who have condemned
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like
also to talk with you about this thing which has happened,
while the magistrates are busy, and before I go
to the place at which I must die. Stay then a while, for
we may as well talk with one another while there is time.
You are my friends, and I should like to show you the
meaning of this event which has happened to me. O my
judges<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>for you I may truly call judges<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I should like
to tell you of a wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the
familiar oracle within me has constantly been in the habit
of opposing me even about trifles, if I was going to make
a slip or error about anything; and now as you see there
has come upon me that which may be thought, and is
generally believed to be, the last and worst evil. But the
oracle made no sign of opposition, either as I was leaving
my house and going out in the morning, or when I was
going up into this court, or while I was speaking, at anything
which I was going to say; and yet I have often
been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing
I either said or did touching this matter has the
oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the explanation
of this? I will tell you. I regard this as a proof
that what has happened to me is a good, and that those
of us who think that death is an evil are in error. This
is a great proof to me of what I am saying, for the customary
sign would surely have opposed me had I been
going to evil and not to good.</p>

<p>Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that
there is great reason to hope that death is a good, for one
of two things: either death is a state of nothingness and
utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change
and migration of the soul from this world to another.
Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by
the sight of dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain.
For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep
was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare
with this the other days and nights of his life, and then
were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed
in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than
this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private
man, but even the great king will not find many such
days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if
death is like this, I say that to die is gain; for eternity
is then only a single night. But if death is the journey
to another place, and there, as men say, all the dead are,
what good, O my friends and judges, can be greater than
this? If indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world
below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in
this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give
judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and, <ins class="translit" title="AE ligature">&#198;</ins>acus,
and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who were righteous
in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth
making. What would not a man give if he might converse
with Orpheus and Mus<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>us and Hesiod and Homer?
Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I, too,
shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can
converse with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon,
and other heroes of old, who have suffered death through
an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure,
as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs.
Above all, I shall be able to continue my search into true
and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in that; I
shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise,
and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to be
able to examine the leader of the great Trojan expedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>tion;
or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others,
men and women too? What infinite delight would there
be in conversing with them and asking them questions!
For in that world they do not put a man to death for
this; certainly not. For besides being happier in that
world than in this, they will be immortal, if what is said
is true.</p>

<p>Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death,
and know this of a truth<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that no evil can happen to a
good man, either in life or after death. He and his are
not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching
end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to
die and be released was better for me; and therefore the
oracle gave no sign. For which reason, also, I am not
angry with my accusers or my condemners; they have
done me no harm, although neither of them meant to do
me any good; and for this I may gently blame them.</p>

<p>Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons
are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to punish
them, and I would have you trouble them, as I have
troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything,
more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be
something when they are really nothing,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>then reprove
them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about that
for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are
something when they are really nothing. And if you do
this, I and my sons will have received justice at your
hands.</p>

<p>The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>I
to die, and you to live. Which is better God only
knows.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">James Anthony Froude</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1818-</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature"><span class="smcap">&#230;</span></ins><span class="smcap">sar</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar it may be said that he came into the world
at a special time and for a special object. The old religions
were dead, from the Pillars of Hercules to the
Euphrates and the Nile, and the principles on which human
society had been constructed were dead also. There
remained of spiritual conviction only the common and
human sense of justice and morality; and out of this
sense some ordered system of government had to be constructed,
under which quiet men could live, and labor, and
eat the fruit of their industry. Under a rule of this material
kind there can be no enthusiasm, no chivalry, no
saintly aspirations, no patriotism of the heroic type. It
was not to last forever. A new life was about to dawn
for mankind. Poetry, and faith, and devotion were to
spring again out of the seeds which were sleeping in the
heart of humanity. But the life which is to endure
grows slowly; and as the soil must be prepared before
the wheat can be sown, so before the Kingdom of Heaven
could throw up its shoots there was needed a kingdom of
this world where the nations were neither torn in pieces
by violence nor were rushing after false ideals and spurious
ambitions. Such a kingdom was the Empire of the
C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sars<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a kingdom where peaceful men could work,
think, and speak as they pleased, and travel freely among
provinces ruled for the most part by Gallios who protected
life and property, and forbade fanatics to tear each
other in pieces for their religious opinions. "It is not
lawful for us to put any man to death," was the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>plaint
of the Jewish priests to the Roman governor.
Had Europe and Asia been covered with independent
nations, each with a local religion represented in its ruling
powers, Christianity must have been stifled in its
cradle. If St. Paul had escaped the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem,
he would have been torn to pieces by the silversmiths
at Ephesus. The appeal to C<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>sar's judgment-seat
was the shield of his mission, and alone made possible
his success.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">John Ruskin</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1819-</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Sesame and Lilies</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, returning to the broader question what these
arts and labors of life have to teach us of its mystery,
this is the first of their lessons<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that the more beautiful
the art, the more it is essentially the work of people who
<i>feel themselves wrong</i>;<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who are striving for the fulfilment
of a law, and the grasp of a loveliness, which they
have not yet attained, which they feel even farther and
farther from attaining, the more they strive for it. And
yet, in still deeper sense, it is the work of people who
know also that they are right. The very sense of inevitable
error from their purpose marks the perfectness of
that purpose, and the continued sense of failure arises
from the continued opening of the eyes more clearly to
all the sacredest laws of truth.</p>

<p>This is one lesson. The second is a very plain, and
greatly precious one, namely:<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that whenever the arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and labors of life are fulfilled in this spirit of striving
against misrule, and doing whatever we have to do, honorably
and perfectly, they invariably bring happiness, as
much as seems possible to the nature of man. In all other
paths, by which that happiness is pursued, there is disappointment,
or destruction: for ambition and for passion
there is no rest<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>no fruition; the fairest pleasures of youth
perish in a darkness greater than their past light; and
the loftiest and purest love too often does but inflame the
cloud of life with endless fire of pain. But, ascending
from lowest to highest, through every scale of human industry,
that industry worthily followed, gives peace. Ask
the laborer in the field, at the forge, or in the mine; ask
the patient, delicate-fingered artisan, or the strong-armed,
fiery-hearted worker in bronze, and in marble, and with
the colors of light; and none of these, who are true workmen,
will ever tell you, that they have found the law of
heaven an unkind one<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that in the sweat of their face
they should eat bread, till they return to the ground; nor
that they ever found it an unrewarded obedience, if, indeed,
it was rendered faithfully to the command<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>do it with thy might."</p>

<p>These are the two great and constant lessons which our
laborers teach us of the mystery of life. But there is another,
and a sadder one, which they cannot teach us,
which we must read on their tombstones.</p>

<p>"Do it with thy might." There have been myriads
upon myriads of human creatures who have obeyed this
law<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who have put every breath and nerve of their being
into its toil<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who have devoted every hour, and exhausted
every faculty<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who have bequeathed their unaccomplished
thoughts at death<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who being dead, have yet
spoken, by majesty of memory, and strength of example.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
And, at last, what has all this "Might" of humanity
accomplished, in six thousand years of labor and sorrow?
What has it <i>done</i>? Take the three chief occupations and
arts of men, one by one, and count their achievements.
Begin with the first<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the lord of them all<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>agriculture. Six
thousand years have passed since we were set to till the
ground, from which we were taken. How much of it is
tilled? How much of that which is, wisely or well? In
the very centre and chief garden of Europe<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>where the
two forms of parent Christianity have had their fortresses<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>where
the noble Catholics of the Forest Cantons, and
the noble Protestants of the Vaudois valleys, have maintained,
for dateless ages, their faiths and liberties<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>there
the unchecked Alpine rivers yet run wild in devastation:
and the marshes, which a few hundred men could redeem
with a year's labor, still blast their helpless inhabitants
into fevered idiotism. That is so, in the centre of Europe!
While, on the near coast of Africa, once the Garden of the
Hesperides, an Arab woman, but a few sunsets since, ate
her child, for famine. And, with all the treasures of the
East at our feet, we, in our own dominion, could not find
a few grains of rice, for a people that asked of us no more;
but stood by, and saw five hundred thousand of them
perish of hunger.</p>

<p>Then, after agriculture, the art of kings, take the next
head of human arts<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>weaving; the art of queens, honored
of all noble Heathen women, in the person of their
virgin goddess<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>honored of all Hebrew women, by the
word of their wisest king<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"She layeth her hands to the
spindle, and her hands hold the distaff; she stretcheth
out her hand to the poor. She is not afraid of the snow
for her household, for all her household are clothed with
scarlet. She maketh herself covering of tapestry, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
clothing is silk and purple. She maketh fine linen, and
selleth it, and delivereth girdles to the merchant." What
have we done in all these thousands of years with this
bright art of Greek maid and Christian matron? Six
thousand years of weaving, and have we learned to
weave? Might not every naked wall have been purple
with tapestry, and every feeble breast fenced with sweet
colors from the cold? What have we done? Our fingers
are too few, it seems, to twist together some poor covering
for our bodies. We set our streams to work for us, and
choke the air with fire, to turn our spinning-wheels,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>are
we yet clothed</i>? Are not the streets of the capitals
of Europe foul with the sale of cast clouts and rotten
rags? Is not the beauty of your sweet children left in
wretchedness of disgrace, while, with better honor, nature
clothes the brood of the bird in its nest, and the suckling
of the wolf in her den? And does not every winter's
snow robe what you have not robed, and shroud what
you have not shrouded; and every winter's wind bear up
to heaven its wasted souls, to witness against you hereafter,
by the voice of their Christ,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"I was naked, and
ye clothed me not"?</p>

<p>Lastly<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>take the Art of Building<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the strongest-proudest<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>most
orderly<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>most enduring of the arts of
man, that of which the produce is in the surest manner
accumulative, and need not perish, or be replaced; but if
once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced
rocks<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>more prevalently than the crumbling hills.
The art which is associated with all civic pride and sacred
principle; with which men record their power<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>satisfy
their enthusiasm<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>make sure their defence<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>define and
make dear their habitation. And, in six thousand years
of building, what have we done? Of the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
all that skill and strength, <i>no</i> vestige is left, but fallen
stones, that encumber the fields and impede the streams.
But from this waste of disorder, and of time, and of rage,
what <i>is</i> left to us? Constructive and progressive creatures,
that we are, with ruling brains, and forming hands;
capable of fellowship, and thirsting for fame, can we not
contend, in comfort, with the insects of the forest, or, in
achievement, with the worm of the sea? The white surf
rages in vain against the ramparts built by poor atoms of
scarcely nascent life; but only ridges of formless ruin
mark the places where once dwelt our noblest multitudes.
The ant and the moth have cells for each of their young, but
our little ones lie in festering heaps, in homes that consume
them like graves; and night by night, from the corners
of our streets, rises up the cry of the homeless<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"I
was a stranger, and ye took me not in."</p>

<p>Must it be always thus? Is our life forever to be without
profit<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>without possession? Shall the strength of
its generations be as barren as death; or cast away their
labor, as the wild fig-tree casts her untimely figs? Is it
all a dream then<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the desire of the eyes and the pride
of life<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>or, if it be, might we not live in nobler dream
than this? The poets and prophets, the wise men, and
the scribes, though they have told us nothing about a life
to come, have told us much about the life that is now.
They have had<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they also,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>their dreams, and we have
laughed at them. They have dreamed of mercy, and of
justice; they have dreamed of peace and good-will; they
have dreamed of labor undisappointed, and of rest undisturbed;
they have dreamed of fulness in harvest, and
overflowing in store; they have dreamed of wisdom in
council, and of providence in law; of gladness of parents,
and strength of children, and glory of gray hairs. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
at these visions of theirs we have mocked, and held
them for idle and vain, unreal and unaccomplishable.
What have we accomplished with our realities? Is this
what has come of our worldly wisdom, tried against their
folly? this our mightiest possible, against their impotent
ideal? or have we only wandered among the spectra of a
baser felicity, and chased phantoms of the tombs, instead
of visions of the Almighty; and walked after the imaginations
of our evil hearts, instead of after the counsels
of Eternity, until our lives<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>not in the likeness of the
cloud of heaven, but of the smoke of hell<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>have become
"as a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then
vanisheth away"?</p>

<p><i>Does</i> it vanish then? Are you sure of that?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>sure,
that the nothingness of the grave will be a rest from this
troubled nothingness; and that the coiling shadow,
which disquiets itself in vain, cannot change into the
smoke of the torment that ascends forever? Will any
answer that they <i>are</i> sure of it, and that there is no fear,
nor hope, nor desire, nor labor, whither they go? Be it
so; will you not, then, make as sure of the Life, that now
is, as you are of the Death that is to come? Your hearts
are wholly in this world<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>will you not give them to it
wisely, as well as perfectly? And see, first of all, that you
<i>have</i> hearts, and sound hearts, too, to give. Because you
have no heaven to look for, is that any reason that you
should remain ignorant of this wonderful and infinite earth,
which is firmly and instantly given you in possession?
Although your days are numbered, and the following
darkness sure, is it necessary that you should share the
degradation of the brute, because you are condemned to
its mortality; or live the life of the moth, and of the
worm, because you are to companion them in the dust?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Not so; we may have but a few thousands of days to
spend, perhaps hundreds only<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>perhaps tens; nay, the
longest of our time and best, looked back on, will be but
as a moment, as the twinkling of an eye; still, we are
men, not insects; we are living spirits, not passing clouds.
"He maketh the winds His messengers; the momentary
fire, His minister;" and shall we do less than <i>these</i>?
Let us do the work of men while we bear the form of
them; and, as we snatch our narrow portion of time out
of Eternity, snatch also our narrow inheritance of passion
out of Immortality<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>even though our lives <i>be</i> as a
vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
away.</p>

<p>But there are some of you who believe not this<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>who
think this cloud of life has no such close<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that it is to
float, revealed and illumined, upon the floor of heaven,
in the day when He cometh with clouds, and every eye
shall see Him. Some day, you believe, within these five,
or ten, or twenty years, for every one of us the judgment
will be set, and the books opened. If that be true, far
more than that must be true. Is there but one day of
judgment? Why, for us every day is a day of judgment<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>every
day is a Dies Ir<ins class="translit" title="ae ligature">&#230;</ins>, and writes its irrevocable
verdict in the flame of its West. Think you that judgment
waits till the doors of the grave are opened? It
waits at the doors of your houses<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>it waits at the corners
of your streets; we are in the midst of judgment<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the
insects that we crush are our judges<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the moments we
fret away are our judges<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>the elements that feed us,
judge, as they minister<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and the pleasures that deceive
us, judge as they indulge. Let us, for our lives, do the
work of Men while we bear the Form of them, if indeed
those lives are <i>Not</i> as a vapor, and do <i>Not</i> vanish away.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4><span class="smcap">James Russell Lowell</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1819-</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">My Garden Acquaintance</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> return of the robin is commonly announced by
the newspapers, like that of eminent or notorious people
to a watering-place, as the first authentic notification of
spring. And such his appearance in the orchard and
garden undoubtedly is. But, in spite of his name of
migratory thrush, he stays with us all winter, and I have
seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees
below zero of Fahrenheit, armed impregnably within,
like Emerson's Titmouse, and as cheerful as he. The
robin has a bad reputation among people who do not
value themselves less for being fond of cherries. There
is, I admit, a spice of vulgarity in him, and his song is
rather of the Bloomfield sort, too largely ballasted with
prose. His ethics are of the Poor Richard school, and
the main chance which calls forth all his energy is altogether
of the belly. He never has those fine intervals of
lunacy into which his cousins, the catbird and the mavis,
are apt to fall. But for a' that and twice as muckle 's a'
that, I would not exchange him for all the cherries that
ever came out of Asia Minor. With whatever faults, he
has not wholly forfeited that superiority which belongs
to the children of nature. He has a finer taste in fruit
than could be distilled from many successive committees
of the Horticultural Society, and he eats with a relishing
gulp not inferior to Dr. Johnson's. He feels and freely
exercises his right of eminent domain. His is the earliest
mess of green peas; his all the mulberries I had fancied
mine. But if he get also the lion's share of the rasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>berries,
he is a great planter, and sows those wild ones in
the woods, that solace the pedestrian and give a momentary
calm even to the jaded victims of the White
Hills. He keeps a strict eye over one's fruit, and knows
to a shade of purple when your grapes have cooked long
enough in the sun. During a severe drought a few years
ago, the robins wholly vanished from my garden. I
neither saw nor heard one for three weeks. Meanwhile
a small foreign grape-vine, rather shy of bearing, seemed
to find the dusty air congenial, and, dreaming perhaps
of its sweet Argos across the sea, decked itself, with a
score or so of fair bunches. I watched them from day
to day till they should have secreted sugar enough from
the sunbeams, and at last made up my mind that I would
celebrate my vintage the next morning. But the robins
too had somehow kept note of them. They must have
sent out spies, as did the Jews into the promised land,
before I was stirring. When I went with my basket, at
least a dozen of these winged vintagers bustled out from
among the leaves, and alighting on the nearest trees interchanged
some shrill remarks about me of a derogatory
nature. They had fairly sacked the vine. Not Wellington's
veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town; not
Federals or Confederates were ever more impartial in
the confiscation of neutral chickens. I was keeping my
grapes a secret to surprise the fair Fidele with, but the
robins made them a profounder secret to her than I had
meant. The tattered remnant of a single bunch was all
my harvest-home. How paltry it looked at the bottom
of my basket,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>as if a humming-bird had laid her egg
in an eagle's nest! I could not help laughing; and the
robins seemed to join heartily in the merriment. There
was a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
abundance, but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign
flavor. Could I tax them with want of taste?</p>

<p>The robins are not good solo singers, but their chorus,
as, like primitive fire-worshippers, they hail the return of
light and warmth to the world, is unrivalled. There are
a hundred singing like one. They are noisy enough
then, and sing, as poets should, with no afterthought.
But when they come after cherries to the tree near my
window, they muffle their voices, and their faint <i>pip, pip,
pop</i>! sounds far away at the bottom of the garden, where
they know I shall not suspect them of robbing the great
black-walnut of its bitter-rinded store.<a name="FNanchor_P_53" id="FNanchor_P_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_53" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> They are
feathered Pecksniffs, to be sure, but then how brightly
their breasts, that look rather shabby in the sunlight,
shine in a rainy day against the dark green of the fringe-tree!
After they have pinched and shaken all the life
out of an earthworm, as Italian cooks pound all the
spirit out of a steak, and then gulped him, they stand up
in honest self-confidence, expand their red waistcoats
with the virtuous air of a lobby member, and outface
you with an eye that calmly challenges inquiry. "Do <i>I</i>
look like a bird that knows the flavor of raw vermin? I
throw myself upon a jury of my peers. Ask any robin
if he ever ate anything less ascetic than the frugal berry
of the juniper, and he will answer that his vow forbids
him." Can such an open bosom cover such depravity?
Alas, yes! I have no doubt his breast was redder at
that very moment with the blood of my raspberries. On
the whole, he is a doubtful friend in the garden. He
makes his dessert of all kinds of berries, and is not averse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
from early pears. But when we remember how omnivorous
he is, eating his own weight in an incredibly short
time, and that Nature seems exhaustless in her invention
of new insects hostile to vegetation, perhaps we may
reckon that he does more good than harm. For my own
part, I would rather have his cheerfulness and kind neighborhood
than many berries.<br /><br /></p>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Cowper</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> world into which Cowper came was one very adverse
to him, and at the same time very much in need of
him. It was a world from which the spirit of poetry
seemed to have fled. There could be no stronger proof
of this than the occupation of the throne of Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Milton, by the arch-versifier Pope. The
Revolution of 1688 was glorious, but unlike the Puritan
Revolution which it followed, and in the political sphere
partly ratified, it was profoundly prosaic. Spiritual religion,
the source of Puritan grandeur and of the poetry
of Milton, was almost extinct; there was not much more
of it among the Nonconformists, who had now become to
a great extent mere Whigs, with a decided Unitarian
tendency. The Church was little better than a political
force cultivated and manipulated by political leaders for
their own purposes. The Bishops were either politicians,
or theological polemics collecting trophies of victory over
free-thinkers as titles to higher preferment. The inferior
clergy as a body were far nearer in character to Trulliber
than to Dr. Primrose; coarse, sordid, neglectful of their
duties, shamelessly addicted to sinecurism and pluralities,
fanatics in their Toryism and in attachment to their corporate
privileges, cold, rationalistic, and almost heathen
in their preachings, if they preached at all. The society
of the day is mirrored in the pictures of Hogarth in the
works of Fielding and Smollett; hard and heartless
polish was the best of it; and not a little of it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
<i>Marriage</i> <ins class="translit" title="a grave"><i>&#224;</i></ins> <i>la Mode</i>. Chesterfield, with his soulless culture,
his court graces, and his fashionable immoralities,
was about the highest type of an English gentleman;
but the Wilkeses, Potters, and Sandwiches, whose mania
for vice culminated in the Hell-fire Club, were more
numerous than the Chesterfields. Among the country
squires, for one Allworthy, or Sir Roger de Coverley, there
were many Westerns. Among the common people
religion was almost extinct, and assuredly no new morality
or sentiment, such as Positivists now promise, had
taken its place. Sometimes the rustic thought for himself,
and scepticism took formal possession of his mind;
but as we see from one of Cowper's letters, it was a
coarse scepticism which desired to be buried with its
hounds. Ignorance and brutality reigned in the cottage.
Drunkenness reigned in palace and cottage alike.
Gambling, cock-fighting, and bull-fighting were the
amusements of the people. Political life, which, if it
had been pure and vigorous, might have made up for the
absence of spiritual influences, was corrupt from the top
of the scale to the bottom: its effect on national character
is portrayed in Hogarth's <i>Election</i>. That property
had its duties as well as its rights, nobody had yet ventured
to say or think. The duty of a gentleman towards
his own class was to pay his debts of honor, and
to fight a duel whenever he was challenged by one of his
own order; towards the lower class his duty was none.
Though the forms of government were elective, and Cowper
gives us a description of the candidate at election
time obsequiously soliciting votes, society was intensely
aristocratic, and each rank was divided from that below
it by a sharp line which precluded brotherhood or sympathy.
Says the Duchess of Buckingham to Lady Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>tingdon,
who had asked her to come and hear Whitefield,
"I thank your ladyship for the information concerning
the Methodist preachers; their doctrines are most repulsive,
and strongly tinctured with disrespect towards their
superiors, in perpetually endeavoring to level all ranks
and do away with all distinctions. It is monstrous to
be told you have a heart as sinful as the common wretches
that crawl on the earth. This is highly offensive and
insulting; and I cannot but wonder that your ladyship
should relish any sentiments so much at variance
with high rank and good breeding. I shall be most
happy to come and hear your favorite preacher." Her
Grace's sentiments towards the common wretches that
crawl on the earth were shared, we may be sure, by her
Grace's waiting-maid. Of humanity there was as little
as there was of religion. It was the age of the criminal
law which hanged men for petty thefts, of life-long imprisonment
for debt, of the stocks and the pillory, of a
Temple Bar garnished with the heads of traitors, of the
unreformed prison system, of the press-gang, of unrestrained
tyranny and savagery at public schools. That
the slave trade was iniquitous hardly any one suspected;
even men who deemed themselves religious took part in
it without scruple. But a change was at hand, and a still
mightier change was in prospect. At the time of Cowper's
birth, John Wesley was twenty-eight, and Whitefield
was seventeen. With them the revival of religion, was
at hand. Johnson, the moral reformer, was twenty-two.
Howard was born, and in less than a generation Wilberforce
was to come.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Thomas Henry Huxley</span>.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>1825-</h4>

<h4><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Lay Sermons, Addresses, and Reviews</span>.</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><span class="smcap">Suppose</span> it were perfectly certain that the life and fortune
of every one of us would, one day or other, depend
upon his winning or losing a game at chess. Don't you
think that we should all consider it to be a primary duty
to learn at least the names and the moves of the pieces;
to have a notion of a gambit, and a keen eye for all the
means of giving and getting out of check? Do you not
think that we should look with a disapprobation amounting
to scorn, upon the father who allowed his son, or the
state which allowed its members, to grow up without
knowing a pawn from a knight?</p>

<p>Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that the
life, the fortune, and the happiness of every one of us,
and, more or less, of those who are connected with us, do
depend upon our knowing something of the rules of a
game infinitely more difficult and complicated than chess.
It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every
man and woman of us being one of the two players in a
game of his or her own. The chess-board is the world,
the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules
of the game are what we call the laws of Nature. The
player on the other side is hidden from us. We know
that his play is always fair, just, and patient. But also
we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake,
or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. To the
man who plays well, the highest stakes are paid, with that
sort of overflowing generosity with which the strong
shows delight in strength. And one who plays ill is
checkmated<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>without haste, but without remorse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>My metaphor will remind some of you of the famous
picture in which Retzsch has depicted Satan playing at
chess with man for his soul. Substitute for the mocking
fiend in that picture, a calm, strong angel, who is playing
for love, as we say, and would rather lose than win<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>and
I should accept it as an image of human life.</p>

<p>Well, what I mean by Education, is learning the rules
of this mighty game. In other words, education is the
instruction of the intellect in the laws of Nature, under
which name I include not merely things and their forces,
but men and their ways; and the fashioning of the affections
and of the will into an earnest and loving desire to
move in harmony with those laws. For me, education
means neither more nor less than this. Anything which
professes to call itself education must be tried by this
standard, and if it fails to stand the test, I will not call it
education, whatever may be the force of authority, or of
numbers, upon the other side.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that, in strictness, there
is no such thing as an uneducated man. Take an extreme
case. Suppose that an adult man, in the full
vigor of his faculties, could be suddenly placed in the
world, as Adam is said to have been, and then left to do
as he best might. How long would he be left uneducated?
Not five minutes. Nature would begin to
teach him, through the eye, the ear, the touch, the properties
of objects. Pain and pleasure would be at his
elbow telling him to do this and avoid that; and by slow
degrees the man would receive an education, which, if
narrow, would be thorough, real, and adequate to his
circumstances, though there would be no extras and very
few accomplishments.</p>

<p>And if to this solitary man entered a second Adam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
or, better still, an Eve, a new and greater world, that of
social and moral phenomena, would be revealed. Joys
and woes, compared with which all others might seem
but faint shadows, would spring from the new relations.
Happiness and sorrow would take the place of the coarser
monitors, pleasure and pain; but conduct would still be
shaped by the observation of the natural consequences
of actions; or, in other words, by the laws of the nature
of man.</p>

<p>To every one of us the world was once as fresh and
new as to Adam. And then, long before we were susceptible
of any other mode of instruction, Nature took
us in hand, and every minute of waking life brought its
educational influence, shaping our actions into rough
accordance with Nature's laws, so that we might not be
ended untimely by too gross disobedience. Nor should
I speak of this process of education as past for any one,
be he as old as he may. For every man, the world is as
fresh as it was at the first day, and as full of untold
novelties for him who has the eyes to see them. And
Nature is still continuing her patient education of us in
that great university, the universe, of which we are all
members<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Nature having no Test-Acts.</p>

<p>Those who take honors in Nature's university, who
learn the laws which govern men and things, and obey
them, are the really great and successful men in this
world. The great mass of mankind are the "Poll," who
pick up just enough to get through without much discredit.
Those who won't learn at all are plucked; and
then you can't come up again. Nature's pluck means
extermination.</p>

<p>Thus the question of compulsory education is settled
so far as Nature is concerned. Her bill on that question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
was framed and passed long ago. But, like all compulsory
legislation, that of Nature is harsh and wasteful
in its operation. Ignorance is visited as sharply as wilful
disobedience<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>incapacity meets with the same punishment
as crime. Nature's discipline is not even a word
and a blow, and the blow first; but the blow without
the word. It is left to you to find out why your ears are
boxed.</p>

<p>The object of what we commonly call education<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>that
education in which man intervenes and which I shall
distinguish as artificial education<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>is to make good these
defects in Nature's methods; to prepare the child to receive
Nature's education, neither incapably nor ignorantly,
nor with wilful disobedience; and to understand
the preliminary symptoms of her displeasure, without
waiting for the box on the ear. In short, all artificial
education ought to be an anticipation of natural education.
And a liberal education is an artificial education,
which has not only prepared a man to escape the great
evils of disobedience to natural laws, but has trained him
to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards which Nature
scatters with as free a hand as her penalties.</p>

<p>That man, I think, has had a liberal education, who
has been so trained in youth that his body is the ready
servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all
the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose
intellect is a clear, cold, logic engine, with all its parts
of equal strength, and in smooth working order; ready,
like a steam engine, to be turned to any kind of work,
and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of
the mind; whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the
great and fundamental truths of Nature and of the laws
of her operations; one, who, no stunted ascetic, is full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
life and fire, but whose passions are trained to come to
heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience;
who has learned to love all beauty, whether of
Nature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others
as himself.</p>

<p>Such an one and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal
education; for he is, as completely as a man can be, in
harmony with Nature. He will make the best of her, and
she of him. They will get on together rarely; she as
his ever beneficent mother; he as her mouth-piece, her
conscious self, her minister and interpreter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_Q_54" id="Footnote_Q_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Q_54"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> These scenes are enacted at the "Prophet's Town," an Indian village, situated
at the junction of the Tippecanoe river with the Wabash, the latter a
tributary of the Ohio. Tecumseh is gone on a mission to the Southern Indians
to induce them to unite in a confederation of all the Indian tribes, leaving
his brother, the Prophet, in charge of the tribes already assembled, having
strictly enjoined upon him not to quarrel with the Americans, or Long-Knives,
as the Indians called them, during his absence. General Harrison, Governor
of Indiana, and commander of the American forces, having learned of Tecumseh's
plans, marches to attack the Prophet; but the latter, pretending to be
friendly, sends out some chiefs to meet Harrison. By the advice of these chiefs,
the Americans encamp on an elevated plateau, near the Prophet's Town,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>"a
very fitting place," to the mind of Harrison's officers, but to the practised eye
of Harrison himself, also well fitted for a night attack by the Indians. He,
therefore, very wisely makes all necessary preparations for defence against any
sudden attack. Tecumseh has left behind him, under the protection of the
Prophet, his wife, Mamatee, and his niece, Iena. He is accompanied on his
mission by Lefroy, an English poet-artist, "enamoured of Indian life, and in
love with Iena." The Prophet, who is hostile to Lefroy, intends to marry Iena
to Tarhay, one of his chiefs, but Mamatee has gone to intercede with her
brother-in-law for Iena, and, if possible, to turn him from his purpose.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_R_55" id="Footnote_R_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_R_55"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> Tecumseh had long foreseen that nothing but combination could prevent
the encroachments of the whites upon the Ohio, and had long been successfully
endeavoring to bring about a union of the tribes who inhabited its valley. The
Fort Wayne treaties gave a wider scope to his design, and he now originated his
great scheme of a federation of the entire red race. In pursuance of this object,
his exertions, hitherto very arduous, became almost superhuman. He made repeated
journeys, and visited almost every tribe from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Great Lakes, and even north of them, and far to the west of the Mississippi.
In order to further his scheme he took advantage of his brother's growing reputation
as a prophet, and allowed him to gain a powerful hold upon the superstitious
minds of his people by his preaching and predictions. The Prophet
professed to have obtained from the Great Spirit a magic bowl, which possessed
miraculous qualities; also a mystic torch, presumably from Nanabush, the keeper
of the sacred fire. He asserted that a certain belt, said to make those invulnerable
who touched it whilst in his hands, was composed of beans which had
grown from his flesh; and this belt was circulated far and wide by Indian runners,
finding its way even to the Red River of the North. These, coupled with
his oratory and mummeries, greatly enhanced an influence which was possibly
added to by a gloomy and saturnine countenance, made more forbidding still
by the loss of an eye. Unfortunately for Tecumseh's enterprise, the Prophet
was more bent upon personal notoriety than upon the welfare of his people;
and, whilst professing the latter, indulged his ambition, in Tecumseh's absence,
by a precipitate attack upon Harrison's force on the Tippecanoe. His defeat
discredited his assumption of supernatural powers, led to distrust and defection,
and wrecked Tecumseh's plan of independent action. But the protection
of his people was Tecumseh's sole ambition; and, true statesman that he was,
he joined the British at Amherstburg (Fort Malden), in Upper Canada, with a
large force, and in the summer of 1812 began that series of services to the British
interest which has made his name a household word in Canada, and endeared
him to the Canadian heart.<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Author's Note</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the roofs of the white Algiers,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Flashingly shadowing the bright bazaar,</span><br />
Flitted the swallows, and not one hears<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The call of the thrushes from far, from far;</span><br />
Sigh'd the thrushes; then, all at once,<br />
Broke out singing the old sweet tones,<br />

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Singing the bridal of sap and shoot,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The tree's slow life between root and fruit.</span></p>

<p>But just when the dingles of April flowers<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Shine with the earliest daffodils,</span><br />
When, before sunrise, the cold clear hours<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Gleam with a promise that noon fulfils,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />

<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Of the alien birds in their African air,</span><br />
And they paused, and alighted, and twitter'd apart,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And met in the broad white dreamy square;</span><br />
And the sad slave woman, who lifted up<br />
From the fountain her broad-lipp'd earthen cup,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Said to herself, with a weary sigh,</span><br />

And in chastest beauty joyest<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Forms most delicate, pure, and clear,<br />
Frost-caught starbeams fallen sheer<br />
In the night, and woven here<br />
In jewel-fretted tapestries.<br />
But what magic melodies,<br />
As in the bord'ring realms are throbbing,<br />
Hast thou, Winter?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>Liquid sobbing<br />
Brooks, and brawling waterfalls,<br />
Whose responsive-voic<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d calls<br />
Clothe with harmony the hills,<br />
Gurgling meadow-threading rills,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Lakelets' lisping wavelets lapping<br />
Round a flock of wild ducks napping,<br />
And the rapturous-noted wooings,<br />
And the molten-throated cooings,<br />
Of the amorous multitudes<br />
Flashing through the dusky woods,<br />
When a veering wind hath blown<br />
A glare of sudden daylight down?<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Naught of these!<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>And fewer notes<br />
Hath the wind alone that floats<br />
Over naked trees and snows;<br />
Half its minstrelsy it owes<br />
To its orchestra of leaves.<br />
Ay! weak the meshes music weaves<br />
For thy snar<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d soul's delight,<br />
'Less, when thou dost lie at night<br />
'Neath the star-sown heavens bright,<br />
To thy sin-unchok<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d ears<br />
Some dim harmonies may pierce<br />
From the high-consulting spheres:<br />
'Less the silent sunrise sing<br />
Like a vibrant silver string<br />
When its prison'd splendors first<br />
O'er the crusted snow-fields burst.<br />
But thy days the silence keep,<br />
Save for grosbeaks' feeble cheep,<br />
Or for snow-birds' busy twitter<br />
When thy breath is very bitter.</p>

<p>So my spirit often acheth<br />
For the melodies it lacketh<br />
'Neath thy sway, or cannot hear<br />
For its mortal-cloak<ins class="translit" title="e grave">&#232;</ins>d ear.<br />
And full thirstily it longeth<br />

<div class="block" style="width: 450px;">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind, the wind where Erie plunged,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Blew, blew nor'-east from land to land;</span><br />
The wandering schooner dipp'd and lunged,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Long Point was close at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
Long Point<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>a swampy island-slant,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Where, busy in their grassy homes,</span><br />
Woodcock and snipe the hollows haunt,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And musk-rats build their domes;</span></p>

<p>Where gulls and eagles rest at need,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Where either side, by lake or sound,</span><br />
Kingfishers, cranes, and divers feed,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And mallard ducks abound.</span></p>

<p>The lowering night shut out the sight:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Careen'd the vessel, pitch'd and veer'd,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
Raved, raved the wind with main and might;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The sunken reef she near'd.</span></p>

<p>She pounded over, lurch'd, and sank;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Between two sand-bars settling fast,</span><br />
Her leaky hull the waters drank,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And she had sail'd her last.</span></p>

<p>Into the rigging, quick as thought,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Captain and mate and sailors sprung,</span><br />
Clamber'd for life, some vantage caught,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And there all night they swung.</span></p>

<p>And it was cold<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>oh, it was cold!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The pinching cold was like a vise:</span><br />
Spoondrift flew freezing,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>fold on fold<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">It coated them with ice.</span></p>

<p>Now when the dawn began to break,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Light up the sand-path drench'd and brown,</span><br />
To fill her bucket from the lake,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Came Mother Becker down.</span></p>

<p>From where her cabin crown'd the bank<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Came Abigail Becker tall and strong:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
She dipp'd, and lo! a broken plank<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Came rocking close along!</span></p>

<p>She pois'd her glass with anxious ken:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The schooner's top she spied from far,</span><br />
And there she counted seven men<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">That clung to mast and spar.</span></p>

<p>And oh, the gale! the rout and roar!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The blinding drift, the mounting wave,</span><br />
A good half-mile from wreck to shore,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">With seven men to save!</span></p>

<p>Sped Mother Becker: "Children! wake!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">A ship's gone down! they're needing me!</span><br />
Your father's off on shore; the lake<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Is just a raging sea!</span></p>

<p>"Get wood, cook fish, make ready all."<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She snatch'd her stores, she fled with haste,</span><br />
In cotton gown and tatter'd shawl,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Barefoot across the waste,</span></p>

<p>Through sinking sands, through quaggy lands,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And nearer, nearer, full in view,</span><br />
Went shouting through her hollow'd hands:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"Courage! we'll get you through!"</span></p>

<p>Ran to and fro, made cheery signs,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Her bonfire lighted, steeped her tea,</span><br />
Brought drift-wood, watch'd Canadian lines<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Her husband's boat to see.</span></p>

<p>Cold, cold it was<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>oh, it was cold!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The bitter cold made watching vain:</span><br />
With ice the channel laboring roll'd,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">No skiff could stand the strain.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
On all that isle, from outer swell<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">To strait between the landings shut,</span><br />
Was never place where man might dwell,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Save trapper Becker's hut.</span></p>

<p>And it was twelve and one and two,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And it was three o'clock and more.</span><br />
She call'd: "Come on! there's nought to do,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">But leap and swim ashore!"</span></p>

<p>Blew, blew the gale; they did not hear:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She waded in the shallow sea;</span><br />
She waved her hands, made signals clear,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"Swim! swim, and trust to me!"</span></p>

<p>"My men," the captain cried, "I'll try:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The woman's judgment may be right;</span><br />
For, swim or sink, seven men must die<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">If here we swing to-night."</span></p>

<p>Far out he mark'd the gathering surge;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Across the bar he watch'd it pour,</span><br />
Let go, and on its topmost verge<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Came riding in to shore.</span></p>

<p>It struck the breaker's foamy track,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Majestic wave on wave uphurl'd,</span><br />
Went grandly toppling, tumbling back,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">As loath to flood the world.</span></p>

<p>There blindly whirling, shorn of strength,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">The captain drifted, sure to drown;</span><br />
Dragg'd seaward half a cable's length,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Like sinking lead went down.</span></p>

<p>Ah, well for him that on the strand<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Had Mother Becker waited long!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
And well for him her grasping hand<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And grappling arm were strong!</span></p>

<p>And well for him that wind and sun,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And daily toil for scanty gains,</span><br />
Had made such daring blood to run<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Within such generous veins!</span></p>

<p>For what to do but plunge and swim?<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Out on the sinking billow cast,</span><br />
She toil'd, she dived, she groped for him,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She found and clutch'd him fast.</span></p>

<p>She climb'd the reef, she brought him up,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She laid him gasping on the sands;</span><br />
Built high the fire and fill'd the cup,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Stood up and waved her hands!</span></p>

<p>Oh, life is dear! The mate leap'd in.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"I know," the captain said, "right well,</span><br />
Not twice can any woman win<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">A soul from yonder hell.</span></p>

<p>"I'll start and meet him in the wave."<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"Keep back!" she bade: "what strength have you?</span><br />
And I shall have you both to save,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Must work to pull you through!"</span></p>

<p>But out he went. Up shallow sweeps<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Raced the long white-caps, comb on comb:</span><br />
The wind, the wind that lash'd the deeps,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Far, far it blew the foam.</span></p>

<p>The frozen foam went scudding by,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Before the wind, a seething throng,</span><br />
The waves, the waves came towering high,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">They flung the mate along.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
The waves came towering high and white.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">They burst in clouds of flying spray:</span><br />
There mate and captain sank from sight,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And, clinching, roll'd away.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mother Becker, seas are dread,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Their treacherous paths are deep and blind!</span><br />
But widows twain shall mourn their dead<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">If thou art slow to find.</span></p>

<p>She sought them near, she sought them far,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Three fathoms down she gripp'd them tight;</span><br />
With both together up the bar<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She stagger'd into sight.</span></p>

<p>Beside the fire her burdens fell:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She paus'd the cheering draught to pour,</span><br />
Then waved her hands: "All's well! all's well!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Come on! swim! swim ashore!"</span></p>

<p>Sure, life is dear, and men are brave:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">They came,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins>they dropp'd from mast and spar;<br />
And who but she could breast the wave,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And dive beyond the bar?</span></p>

<p>Dark grew the sky from east to west,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And darker, darker grew the world:</span><br />
Each man from off the breaker's crest<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">To gloomier deeps was hurl'd.</span></p>

<p>And still the gale went shrieking on,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And still the wrecking fury grew;</span><br />
And still the woman, worn and wan,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Those gates of Death went through,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins></p>

<p>As Christ were walking on the waves,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And heavenly radiance shone about,</span><ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
All fearless trod that gulf of graves<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And bore the sailors out.</span></p>

<p>Down came the night, but far and bright,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Despite the wind and flying foam,</span><br />
The bonfire flamed to give them light<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">To trapper Becker's home.</span></p>

<p>Oh, safety after wreck is sweet!<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">And sweet is rest in hut or hall:</span><br />
One story Life and Death repeat,<ins class="translit" title="em dash">&#8212;</ins><br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">God's mercy over all.</span></p>

<hr class="center" style="width: 45%;" /><br />

<p>Next day men heard, put out from shore,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Cross'd channel-ice, burst in to find</span><br />
Seven gallant fellows sick and sore,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">A tender nurse and kind;</span></p>

<p>Shook hands, wept, laugh'd, were crazy-glad;<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Cried: "Never yet, on land or sea,</span><br />
Poor dying, drowning sailors had<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">A better friend than she.</span>
</p>

<p>"Billows may tumble, winds may roar,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">Strong hands the wreck'd from Death may snatch:</span><br />
But never, never, nevermore<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">This deed shall mortal match!"</span></p>

<p>Dear Mother Becker dropp'd her head,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">She blush'd as girls when lovers woo:</span><br />
"I have not done a thing," she said,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 2em;">"More than I ought to do."</span></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
